Seems at his best when he plays like the big man that he is with a bit of nasty. Good hockey sense. Is effective defensively and on offensive, he is terrific when forcing the issue down low. Handles the puck very well and is a good set-up man. He may end up on wing, as he is less set-up man and more shoot first guy, where he displays a lightning fast wrist shot.

His junior team, P.E.I., often asks him to shoulder the load.
