Can make the hard-up-ice blueline break-in from the neutral zone, or with sweet saucer passes from both sides of his stick.",75,Colorado,False,0.5197025962600941,0.4802974037399059
43,2017,Dylan_Samberg,"Minnesota native winner of the Reed Larson award for the state’s best HS senior defenseman in the state. He uses his pro size to play a robust full 200ft game, including finishing on bone-rattling hits. Very strong and mobile, he is well-rounded in all phases and a nice toolbox of skills with room to add more muscle to his frame. He finished the season as a member of the Waterloo USHL team where he will return next year before fulfilling his commitment to the University of Minnesota at Duluth.",89,Winnipeg,False,0.6466996684302357,0.35330033156976426
33,2017,Kole_Lind,"Sleeper pick in the first. He is one of the best goal scorers in the class, but at this juncture is a lightweight who is tall but thin. Has the frame to carry more girth and may grow an inch or two. Has an excellent wrist snapper he gets off quickly and a booming slapper. He is a really strong skater with good balance and displays good edging that helps him turn abruptly to elude defenders. He isn't afraid to protect himself when he plants himself near the blue paint. A strong skater and very good with his zone entries on the carry in. Really has a good hockey sense and quickly advances the biscuit to create good looks. Seems to capitalize whenever he is able to get loose and get open. He is also a good playmaker and stays involved on the attack. He is at his best when he plays with grit and edge, and his play is trending that way. Has really progressed in his WHL career, but still hasn't reached the 45 goals/79 points in 44 games totals he had in Saskatoon midget, but as he gets bigger and stronger, he may just develop into an NHL power scorer.",203,Vancouver,True,0.6214681301696944,0.6214681301696944
31,2017,Klim_Kostin,Big man with good balance who is strong on his pins and difficult to move off the puck. Has a decent shot to go with very good stick skills.  Goes hard to the front of the net. Fearless and always willing to take punishment and not back off from returning some. He might be a better player if he didn't have such a pass-first mentality. Suffered a shoulder injury that will shut him down the rest of the season.,79,St. Louis,True,0.5396300346618722,0.5396300346618722
37,2017,Marcus_Davidsson,"High tempo Swedish centre-forward with excellent speed, lateral agility, and acceleration. Seems to be very active and involved in all three zones. Strong puck pursuit player who pressures to take the puck back, and very fast and elusive in battle areas and tight places when on the attack. Displays a quick release and strong one-timer. Still hasn't shown a dominant offensive game, but has a great first-step burst and a low centre of gravity. He is difficult to stop or take the puck away from. Always moving and an excellent back-checker with an excellent commitment in his own end.",99,Buffalo,True,0.6499144379885797,0.6499144379885797
27,2017,Morgan_Frost,"200 foot centreman who needs a bit more girth, but he comes to play every game every shift, in all three zones. Really hockey smart, steady, and  instinctive in his own end. Despite not being the biggest guy, he will sacrifice his body to clear the defensive zone, or to try and get pucks in the attack zone.  A smart playmaker with a strong work ethic, good hands, and an obsession to get the loose pucks.",76,Philadelphia,True,0.5831958063480797,0.5831958063480797
39,2017,Jason_Robertson,"Big left winger with size, speed, a great shot, and  on-ice intelligence. One of his team's leaders. There are thoughts that his game is hampered by his team lacking a top centre to play off of. He still manages to use his quick wrist shot to score on his own, and he is able to create chances for teammates through his stellar work in the attack zone. He Is a powerful skater with good drive, balance, and acceleration. I have heard the constant criticism of his foot speed, but he gets there and is smart enough to do all the work on scoring plays without it being a huge deterent; he lacks a true first step, but no one can convince me his feet hold hIm back in the NHL, and as he improves them, you don't wait for all the rest of the parts of his game to develop...he has lots there already.  He has a terrific release and drives into the slot area, protecting the puck before he shoots or passes it. Very good board player and defensively responsible.",181,Dallas,True,0.6733772957398656,0.6733772957398656
28,2017,Shane_Bowers,"Highly skilled two way centre that plays a mature 200 game. Has an exceptional hockey IQ and good feet and head. He will slip through the defensive layers to the soft areas and use his quick release to score. He likes the puck on his stick and is a very good passer who is easy for his linemates to follow. He shined at the USHL West Showcase. Still thin, but has room to fill out. The big question is whether scouts and teams see him as a a true NHL second liner or simply with the upside to be a solid 3rd line centre-forward. That, more than anything else, will determine he his name gets called. A very safe pick as the chances are very probable he plays in the league in some capacity.",134,Ottawa,True,0.6786853745715267,0.6786853745715267
26,2017,Jake_Oettinger,"The BU Freshman goaltender has upped his draft status with a solid season and continued improvement with his calm and athletic game that features solid mechanics, good reads, and fluid crease movements. Tracks the puck well, and is poised and ready in his recovery to make the second save on the second shot. Has good anticipation and has been a keystone in some of his team’s wins.",67,Dallas,False,0.6728212051981237,0.3271787948018763
25,2017,Ryan_Poehling,"Strong skating centre-wing who is very strong on his skates and very difficult to contain. Has size and scoring ability to go along with his good feet. Displays a hard, accurate shot. He plays in all situations including the PK & PP. Is willing and able to carry the biscuit out of his own end in transition. Will get stronger and heavier. Will be close to NHL ready sooner than most of his class.",74,Montreal,True,0.5864947470923179,0.5864947470923179
23,2017,Pierre-Olivier_Joseph,"A qualitative jump in his all around play has hurtled him upward into the first round discussions. A player who always looked solid as an improving defender but who this season has gained scads of confidence in his ability to be a key component in the attack. Displays mobility and excellent hockey sense, and has that feel for where play is going before it does. Breaks up rushes and plays in his end with a good stick and strong recognition. A power play quarterback whose frame will allow him to get bigger and as he gets stronger, he will add more mustard to the heat he can bring from the point. His brother, Mathieu, was a Tampa Bay draft pick.",120,Arizona,True,0.5418535588676271,0.5418535588676271
24,2017,Kristian_Vesalainen,"Excellent combination of skill, size, and shot.  Reads and reacts to situations in the attack zone well and is strong on the puck. His quickness allows him to separate the opposition from the puck. Strong quick release. Can play either side and displays power and speed. He closes on defenders with his top burst of speed and they are unprepared for him, which leads to penalties or he will blow straight by them. He makes things look easy, like he is a veteran player, reading the ice so well, making terrific give and go passes, with power and agility in his handling of the biscuit. Terrific finisher with a heavy shot. Looks like a top ten selection at this juncture. Already being touted as ""Jesse Puljujärvi lite,"" there are a lot of similarities, but Vesalainen still has a ways to go.",141,Winnipeg,True,0.6307703373931842,0.6307703373931842
19,2017,Josh_Norris,"Rangy centreman with a long stride who projects as a physical two-way centreman. Strong on the wall, battle areas, and in one on one battles. Good in the dot. Works well down low. Always goes full tilt, never quitting. Will throw pucks at the net from anywhere and then proceed to shake things up looking to retrieve it. Does not have tricky stickhandle moves or slick skating moves, but projects as a pro centre. Committed to the University of Michigan.",80,San Jose,False,0.5879556211612877,0.41204437883871226
15,2017,Erik_Brannstrom,"One of the younger draft eligible defensemen in the class, he is a terrific skater with plenty of offensive skill and a good enough stick to get things done in his own end. He will have to get thicker and more muscle but has great feet and hockey IQ, so don't count him out as a player just because he hasn't matured completely. Quick on ice thinker who is an excellent stickhandler to blend with his quick feet and shiftiness. Aggressive powerplay point man with a big time wrist shot, and moves the puck quickly and efficiently on the man advantage. At times was a one man show in the Five Nations Tourney, where he gained the zone easily and fly with the bisquit on his blade.",127,Vegas,True,0.67430167933169,0.67430167933169
18,2017,Urho_Vaakanainen,"A year or so back, he was considered one of the Finnish jewels of this class, but there is some doubt as to whether he truly projects as a top four NHL player: he is of only average size,  has little ruggedness, or few abilities that project him as a stay at home defender. He skates well and has some up-ice skill, but hasn’t grown into a top offensive defenseman at this juncture.",73,Boston,False,0.5204165987687062,0.47958340123129384
14,2017,Cal_Foote,"Big defenseman with a big point shot. Not necessarily a polished puck carrier, but is surprisingly agile going East-West. He is excellent in his own end to cover attackers and space. Uses his size to win wall and battle zone possessions and will clear the front. No mean streak, but is a really solid competitor for 60 minutes. Plays on both the penalty kill and the power play. Excellent hockey sense and reads his own end well. Stays square on rushers and takes them outside, using his stick to take away their time and space. Very good on his feet and light on his edging, and able to play strong on the puck. Has a good low shot that he places on the net. Needs to fill out and get stronger. The Kelowna system has developed many NHL defenders so he seems in a good position to improve and get selected fairly early. Great bloodlines with his father Adam Foote.",160,Tampa Bay,True,0.6591348200199622,0.6591348200199622
17,2017,Timothy_Liljegren,"Started the year ranked as a top defenseman prospect based on smooth and mature play from the back end as a puck mover, attacker and PP man, Thick not large, but there is little on the negative side on how well he uses his abilities to defend. A world class skater who has agility mobility and great acceleration, he displays high hockey IQ and reads the ice as well as any NHL defender. Already in the Swedish Elite league and not at all out of place. He really hasn't gotten any bigger or physically stronger, and that might have him sliding down draft lists from top defenseman in the class to maybe a risky selection early on. He is a strong puck mover who will fearlessly lead the attack as a newbie in the SHL. If he does slide, he may make one NHL team's scouting staff look like geniuses.",150,Toronto,True,0.7627991417723847,0.7627991417723847
13,2017,Nick_Suzuki,"One of the most feared penalty-killers in the OHL, he never goes unnoticed every shift. An under six footer who is a puck magnet, and continually gets loose so his teammates have a scoring outlet.  Responsible defensively and has continued to hone his overall game. Small, but able to both score and set-up his linemates.",55,Vegas,True,0.6034613654893033,0.6034613654893033
11,2017,Gabriel_Vilardi,"Big solid centre-forward who can score. Has come back from injuries and was a top player in the World Junior U-17s. Displays a two-way game, great skills, and uses his body to make space. Best player in the OHL. Smart, strong on the puck and on the cycle. Makes terrific feeds to his teammates and dominates when pucks are in contention. Can come off the edge with truly strong power moves to the front. He has shown true goal scoring abilities and projects as, at the very least, a top six scorer if the trends continue to improve.",98,Los Angeles,True,0.6673143168319072,0.6673143168319072
6,2017,Cody_Glass,"Late bloomer with excellent speed, quick hands, and sneaky release. Since last season he gained 20+ pounds and grew more than a couple inches, making him tough to push of the puck in his possessions. Has a high hockey sense - finds the open seams, gets open, and anticipates where the puck will be. Strong on the puck, keeping it away from from opposing defenders. Displays excellent all-around speed. He looks to get even bigger and stronger, and has significant upside.",81,Vegas,True,0.5904472678507753,0.5904472678507753
4,2017,Cale_Makar,"This small defender has all the making of a future NHL offenseman. Seems to be in constant motion, and able to intercept pucks and turn them in to quick strikes towards his opponent's net. Very undersized and will need plenty more muscle as he continues his development. Cleary one of the smarter and better offensively talented Dmen in the class. The PP QB on his Alberta Junior League team, and has a quick release of a point shot that he gets off without taking a big backswing. He displays strong wrists take enable him to get strength on his shots and zip on his passes. After being selected to play in the World junior Challenge, it what might have been viewed as a step up in competition compared to the players he faces in the AJHL -- but he looked dominant in many phases, using his lateral agility and athletic strides to cut through the neutral zone, activating to open space on the give and go, and reading ensuing plays and covering huge areas of the ice with his feet. His speed and good edging work in consort with his ability to handle the puck at top speed. When he is doesn't have the puck, he looks to jump on errant passes or ones sent cross ice changing possessions. Will pinch but always gets back in position in a few strides because he's so quick. Holds a strong gap. This is a player who creates space and time and plays smart. More of a long term development project -- but he is a player.",264,Colorado,True,0.664215457536727,0.664215457536727
