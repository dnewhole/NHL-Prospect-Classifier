The ""Russian factor"" had him pushed back in the rankings, but his arrival in North America will most certainly gain him strong first round consideration. You don't get a strong two-way defenseman from the outset, but you do get a big physical one who will engage attackers with regularity. There certainly is time for growth of an offensive game, as long as he chooses to stick around North America and develop one.",44,18,292,318,62,Buffalo,London Knights [OHL],Nikita_Zadorov,D,1,True,False,0.5485528632078107
9,2013,"Center-forward on the powerhouse London Knights who has seen time on the wing, and is an exceptional face-off man. Exceptionally strong and effective three-zone stud who is a rock of a specimen. Strong on the puck and in the cycle, as well as coming out to the front with the puck for the shot. Good shot and good passer, he projects as an almost certain selection with upside. As a rookie last year he was on the PK team, and stood out as part of Team Ontario at the 2012 U17 WHC’s, with 4 goals and 7 points in 6 games. Was named the MVP of the OHL playoffs. When the puck is on his stick, you can be sure he either penetrates or quickly dishes to the right man to continue the offensive press. He is an excellent penalty-killer, an aggressive forechecker, and fearless in the dirty areas, whether it be the front or the corners. Currently playing wing, but can play pivot too.",124,98,377,104,222,Vancouver,London Knights [OHL],Bo_Horvat,C,1,True,False,0.5292228789037039
