128,2011,"Big wing who will do the dirty work to unearth pucks in the battle zones, take hits, stand in front, and show prowess below the hash marks. Not the best skater but has balance and fair speed. Needs to be more of a player along the wall, and give a better effort away from the puck. Combined with good hand/eye coordination, vision, solid passing skills, and a quick release hard wrister, there is lots to like.",76,0,0,0,0,0,Columbus,Omaha Lancers [USHL],Seth_Ambroz,F,5,False,True,0.5196506716025342,0.5196506716025342
118,2011,"2010 eligible German import who does not display a lot of jump, but certainly gets there and does work the offensive zone well. He sees the ice well, and has a lot of skill and smarts. His wide body makes him dangerous as he goes to the net. He sees the ice well and is an effective jam player in deep. Huge forward with a good dangle and the potential to be an NHL forward. Shows agility but is raw due and needs time to get stronger, fill-in and get a bit more coordinated, balanced, and hungry.",97,0,0,0,0,0,Philadelphia,Seattle Thunderbirds [WHL],Marcel_Noebels,C,4,False,True,0.5112923717827581,0.5112923717827581
106,2011,"Undersized opportunistic scorer with great stick skills and superb vision, as well as some jump. Good hands and big play ability. Very Good Hockey IQ when diagnosing the ice. He must improve in all phases. It remains to be seen if he can become a stronger player with a 60-minute involvement.",51,0,0,0,0,0,NY Rangers,Edmonton Oil Kings [WHL],Michael_St._Croix,C,4,False,True,0.6580087680893763,0.6580087680893763
