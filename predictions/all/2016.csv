205,2016,Tyler_Soy,"When you see him on the sheet, he seems younger and thinner than everyone else. Has a really short compact stride and he keeps the feet moving the entire shift. Sees the surface well and is good at positioning himself, and anticipating the possible developing play. Is very undeveloped, and needs weight room work to make him able to compete in so many of the areas he now seems a lightweight in. If he can get stronger, he will be able to compete physcality in the areas necessary, his perimeter shot will get stronger, and he will get better in most areas. Good playmaker who needs much more weight to withstand the physicality his up tempo strong forechecking style causes. He has soft hands, is a good face-off man, and always keeps his feet in motion. Has long term upside, and already shows great hand-eye coordination, moves to the open areas in lanes, and seems to place the puck wherever he iswants it to go.

I went into this season thinking of him as I do many hockey siblings - same bloodline but far less talent. My opinion was based on his awkward skating stride and lack of speed. He had high-end offensive instincts, exceptionally soft hands and puck handling skills, but just didn’t display the wheels to complete the portrait. He must have committed to improving his feet and has clearly shown he can generate the attack and make teammates better. He may never reach his brother skill set, but is unselfish to a fault, and strong competitor. He has a really quick shot, but his soft hands make him a brilliant set up artist. He generates chances because he reads situations well, and quickly reacts with precise passes through traffic. As a scorer, he will raise you from your seat with his accurate blistering shot. When his team has possession in the offensive zone, he will find the crack of open space in coverage and surprise with an accurate shot of the pass. His new found quick feet and balance add to his agility and stop/start ability. He always was good East-West who was ultra shifty with the puck. He is now quicker, more dynamic and possible the most skilled player in the draft.",Buffalo,True,0.6899788915259517
5,2016,Olli_Juolevi,"Finnish import defenseman with a good frame and excellent offensive instincts. Displays significant upside as prospect who can eventually be a two way defender. Maintain good gaps and has an active stick. An excellent stickhandler who can be very poised with the puck. Is athletic and mobile and reads the ice well. Is a crisp long distance passer in transition and can also carry the mail out of the zone. Not adverse to going the rush, is an excellent PP QB, and has a strong hard point shot along with a long range writs shot. Very fluid and has a great feel for the offensive end. Has some physicality and will tie opponents on the wall.It is difficult to estimate exactly where he gets selected in the first round. There are plenty of reasons teams would value his vision and instinct in the attacking part of the game, but if you ask scouts which parts of junior defense’s games are most important, backward skating and handling the defensive part of the game rank rank high. He has trouble handling quicker forwards in his end, and also gets out-muscled in the dirty areas, along the wall and when in possession. He needs to get harder on the stick. These are parts of the game that can be improved upon and he does have a some bite to his game, so he is a pretty nice defensive prospect even with the parts he needs to develop.",Vancouver,False,0.5418834702572017
38,2016,Adam_Mascherin,"A sleeper drafted two season back by Florida. Decided to let him re-enter the draft since other NHL clubs didn't offer the second round pick they invested in his selection. He can thread a soft pass or score with his accurate heavy wrist shot. A short, thick centremen who bowls his way around the attack zone. Displays good skills in the attack zone. Not agile laterally or a blazer, he is an excellent North-South skater with speed and will push through defenders if he can find a path around. Strong on the puck in his carries. Displays excellent vision to make plays with his soft passes or his quick trigger. Needs to work on understanding defensive zone positioning. A work in progress that may not be tall but certainly is a tank.",Florida,True,0.5376993826462365
