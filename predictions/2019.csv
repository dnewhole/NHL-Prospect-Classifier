503,0,2019,Philip_Broberg,"Big, mobile Swedish defender who does everything at a high level. Smart, offensive, and physical on defense, he checks all the boxes as a future NHL'er who can play the fast pace and make plays in his end due to his world class skating ability. NHL team scouts that are down grading him are doing so based him not seeing big minutes with his new AIK team, as a new young buck in the pecking order, but there are definite signs of creativity on the offensive side. The same was true as the youngest defender on the Swedish World Junior U-20 team. Granted he showed chinks in his game with over-handles and longer than necessary possessions, and late read/reacts but I would warn NHL teams from dismissing his size and - skill ratios that allows him to explode on his edges and close in all directions, snuffing zone entries, funneling speedy opposing attackers, driving step for step with them, and sometimes showing a bit of edge in contact. One can imagine him being an even more consistent defensive force who finishes checks and strips pucks even more robustly. This lad gets the nuances of his position and might be one of the fastest backward burst skaters at his position. Never stops moving, has the stretch pass down, and a strong heavy low point shot, and the eagerness to apply offensive pressure down low. I see great value selecting him in the top tier of the first round, not later.",TBD,True,0.7415745728014924
504,0,2019,Vasily_Podkolzin,"Dynamic up and winger who can make a difference in every game he plays with his and ability to play a power game, get in tight, barreling through opponents to make plays. Lines up at the half wall from the right side and uses his left shot to fire blasts on the PP. Smart and always in motion, looking to have the puck returned to his possession. He captained the Russian Hlinka Tourney team by example. In the Bronze metal game, while on the PK, he worked the wall in his end to unearth a puck which he quickly got up ice giving his teammate a breakaway. His teammates attempt was stopped and as the USA team tried to exit their defensive end, he meets the exiting US player with contact, and the puck rolls to his teammate at the red line who advances it to him. he enters the zone near the left wall and as the US defender closes, he spins back around and fires a backhand pass to his teammate who got another chance. Always working, and has such quick hands and head. The year the Blues stole Tarasenko 16th overall, I commented in my mock (where I had Tarasenko ""a gift dropping to slot ten"", due to the ""Russian factor"") how this was a top five guy.",TBD,True,0.7421888179741584
505,0,2019,Alex_Turcotte,"Alfie's son is a 200 foot centre with decent size and elite feet and hands. His wide skating base and strong edging work allows him rapid change in direction. Unfazed by venturing into the dirty battle areas. He can finish and his puck-handling, high hockey instincts, and soft hands rate up near the top of the class. An injury-riddled year has set him back a bit, but I wouldn’t count him out of being taken in the early part of the first round. Has great speed, an extra gear and displays strong edging. Has really good patience in his possessions, and will rile defenses into over commitment, nd then place the biscuit on a teammates stick for a shot. He will fearlessly take a hit, kills penalties, block shots and more importantly is an improving in the dot. Has built a two-way game. High end skill, balance, explosive feet and terrific touch may be enough to land NHL suitors who think the end product is going to something special. Has seen action as a winger. Committed to the University of Wisconsin.",TBD,True,0.7215675884810221
506,0,2019,Kirby_Dach,"Got an early taste in the ""Dub"" when injuries befell the forwards on Saksatoon, and showed off his competitive nature and was able to set up and score goals as a 16 year old, and displays smarts, size, good feet and a 200 foot commitment. Not a speedster, but has a great stick and soft hands as a high-end playmaker. Can control the pace and the play. Another wing-centre who is very strong on his skates and can move with above average speed while he maintains possession using his soft hands to find open line mates when he has the puck, and quickly ghost into quiet soft areas to receive returns and scoring looks. When watching a guy this big, you think he is going to get held up but he seems to keep driving effortless keeping the defenders away from the puck with his long reach and staying in motion while he supports the play. He avoids attackers with side-stepping and a quick stick. He follows the action but the action tends to follow him too. Strong in so many phases of the game already, he is always close to attackers in his end nudging close deterring their advance. Is a regular of the PK and PP. I think there is upside as a pro scorer, but many of his goals will continue to come with plays he started where he positioned himself between the circles, stick on the ice, and wasn’t stopped. He is able to read coverages, make sharp cuts, by driving into the turns. His edge work keeps him away from closing traffic, and frequently leaving him uncovered in the dirty areas. Plenty of room to imagine him as blossoming as a scorer as well as set-up guy. May project as an NHL centre. Big guy with big strong wrists, who gets in close and difficult to move out from the front or take the puck away from. It might take time but no NHL team is going to pass on big man with these tools.",TBD,True,0.8021497556929815
507,0,2019,Jack_Hughes,"Orlando Florida born who many are calling the next Patrick Kane. His parents both played the game and his father is an ex-Bruins coach and minor pro coach, whose originally from the Mississauga area. The top line centre in the US program who gets thinks done with strong hands, terrific vision and quick feet. Great anticipation and the ability to hold pucks on his stick no matter where he ventures. He steers pucks through traffic and his terrific vision and edging simply get opponents scrambling and unsure where the play is going to open into a solid look. He can come to a dead stop, and watch a crowd converge on his space, and wire a puck to the open spot of net. Has a terrific shot when he uses it too. Some think he is always willing to attempt inside moves, refusing to get funneled to the periphery and his gambling style might be seen as too abrasive. May project to wing, but we like him as a smaller pivot at this juncture, because he is such a dynamic, fast paced player despite not being the big strong powerful centre teams look for.",TBD,True,0.7706678719281517
508,0,2019,Dylan_Cozens,"Difference making power centre-wing with great wheels, powerful wide base and stride, motor, powerful shot and ability to use his hands to quickly take possessions and make plays. A big power player who will play in traffic every shift and do with some nasty. His veracity in puck battles along the boards makes it necessary to “double cover’ him. World class skater who is very strong on his skates and shows added explosion on the attack, while being able to pass the biscuit with precision and touch. Point per game WHL rookie last season who is committed as a 200 foot player armed with deadly shot selections. This man child isn't through filling in or building his muscle. Makes everyone around him better. Will cause problems in front, or from the perimeters. Exploits the defense and reads linemates well. Fluid non-stop player who plays hockey smart and would fly through a wall to help his team win. Can project as a big centre as well as a big wing. The sky’s the limit.",TBD,True,0.7531896076878252
509,0,2019,Mack_Guzda,"Prototypical big goaltender whose long legs, along with strong four direction movements, has a superb push and slide side to side, a strong mental attitude, and good glove and blocker. Once planted, he is able to thrust to his destination and replant bringing his lateral movement to a abrupt halt. His long torso closes off much of the top part of the net. Always keeps his glove up toward the puck carrier. Has had some issues with clears where he has had miscommunications with his defenseman and clears go awry.",TBD,False,0.507731381845842
510,0,2019,Matthew_Boldy,"WInger with a solid two-way game, who finds the soft spots in coverage, and has plenty of skill and good feet. He is well-balance flyer who can circumnavigate through tight spaces at high speeds and his high level puck skills including super soft hands that let him keep opposing defenders guessing on how they should react. Has nice size, displays a strong wrister, and plays a style that fits so well with the new attacking schemes. Really high end hockey sense, and full throttle involved player whose on-ice presence seems to tip the scales in his team's favor when he is out on the sheet, no matter if it is in open ice, or in tight stick cluttered scenery. Reads, reacts and anticipates and answers with precision through traffic passes and receptions while playing with a cool demeanor. What becomes clear with views of him is that he is continually in scoring position and able to provide a threat whenever his line gets a foothold in the attack zone. Very defensively responsible and fills the uncovered attackers when breakdowns occur. Did I mention his heavy shot and quick release? Committed to Boston College.",TBD,True,0.726833016552599
511,0,2019,Raphaël_Lavoie,"There are diverse opinions on how quickly this huge winger goes off the draft board because he is so dominating against the smaller QMJHL players he regularly plays against. There is no denying he seduces your opinion with his long reach and sneaky deceptive release of the puck that catches goalies off guard. Was added to the World Junior Summer Showcase as an injury replacement and played well when surrounded by really good teammates. At this juncture, he projects more as a right wing, and not a centre. He will have to radically improve his acceleration, foot speed, and pace to be thought capable of patrolling centre ice in higher levels.",TBD,True,0.7006337275298834
512,0,2019,Kaapo_Kakko,"Big Finnish man child with above average size, speed/skill sets. Although is still in need of weight room strength, in both the upper and lower body, he already thinks and advances the puck at a high level and fearlessly drive the front. Moves and stick-handles at top speed, and displays an excellent snap shot. A big kid who maintains possession with his strong hands / stick strength. Strong North-South skater with excellent burst, agility and hockey vision. Can project as a future NHL centre for some clubs seeking a big pivot, but is a perfect fit as a big fast scoring option who plays with a solid playmaking NHL centre.",TBD,True,0.6874955121501138

Hides his release point and shows great velocity and needs very little time or space to shoot and score. He plays heavy on his stick and display a wicked backhand, a quick wrister and devastating one-timers. Has a shake and bake weight shift and use of his edges that allows for surprising shots when they are least expected.  The Wisconsin native is committed to the University of Wisconsin, and size is NOT a concern.",TBD,True,0.555041144747585
515,0,2019,Peyton_Krebs,"Spirited competitor with skill and competitiveness. He was the top pick in the Bantam draft. Dynamic game changing centre-forward with above average skills in all areas and a player who leads by example. Despite not being a big man, he plays a high energy, no shift off game. Has a strong defense zone presence, and battles hard in all three zone. Excellent skater with a long stride, who uses his edges and body to separate himself and not hemmed in, always has enough room to find his teammates or pick a corner with a hard snapper. Displays terrific vision and feel on the attack. Very good face off man, and one of the best in junior at making the right decision of whether to shoot or to pass on every given play. Can no look pass with the best of them. Can play both positions as he ascends to higher levels. A true on ice leader who gives it all shift after shift.",TBD,True,0.7424682696446029
