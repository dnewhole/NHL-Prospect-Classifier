Uses his size to out-muscle opponents and has a deadly shot he is unafraid to use repeatedly. Some would argue that being scoring leader at the World Junior Tourney was a coming out party but he has established himself as a strong player in most phases of the game in the Finnish Pro league. Paired with Patrik Laine as bookend wings for his regular centre in Kärpät , Sebastian Aho, both solidified their status as early selections. I have him with on edge of Laine based on how strong a finisher Puljujärvi is down low. Jesse is a very strong skater and although doesn't appear as a dominant scoring threat shift after shift, he gets his chances and moreover he makes his line one that it is difficult to get scoring chances on. He stays involved shift after shift: He acts as a huge screen. He has terrific hands and a attack zone work tools, including an explosive burst, and smart two-way game.

The move to centre has given him more freedom to be creative in the attack zone and he still plays a reliable defensive game. Can be equally effective at setting up plays and scoring. Had the Tampa Lightning’s strength coach Mark Lambert teach his a pro strength regime. Part of the reasoning behind it he is not a blazing skater and needs a bit more explosiveness in his leg strength. He also is getting a leg up on adding muscle to his entire body. He does have a long stride stride that he can improve on. Competes well in all three zones. Has great vision and a real nice set of hands and is dedicated at improvement in every phase.

He has been heralded for years as a player destined to be selected in the top couple selections. He displays elite feet, balance and edge work. He wants the puck on his stick on zone entries and even chooses to skate the puck solo when the puck transitions to him in his defensive zone. He is so fast that he is able to jump in on the attack on most offensive forays. Always looking for the dynamic pass to set up a goal, the competitive nature in all zones is terrific and fearless.

Solid skater with lateral agility, but he isn’t a blazer, so he exploits the seams & soft spots in coverage. Displays quick hands and a scorers mentality, but doesn’t necessarily use his agility as a one trick pony in the attack zone. He is responsible in all three zones and is competitive in backside pressure. His forte is on the power play; he is able to generate chances, get to soft areas, and use his head and hands to shoot the puck. Has a wicked one-timer, and a quick release - cannon of a snap shot. Has been an elite attacker in the QMJHL. Very patient and has a smart sense about where he should be in the attacking zone. He can beat you with a surprising heavy perimeter shot, or simply gets in closer and sniffs around for scores in the area. Seems to swoop into existing puck battles and come out untouched, quickly moving into the blue dot. He makes the goalie start changing his position and takes advantage with his sneaky backhand or quick wrister. He lit up the World Juniors U-20 for Czech with seven goals in seven games at 18 years of age. He has emerged as one of the top picks in the class because his fiery offensive capabilities may continue to develop into the pro game.

He has great balance and solid skating abilities. Possess decent speed and agility. He showed his ability in the World Junior U-20 where he won puck battle after puck battle and set up a number of big goals, notable late-game tying and winning goals in the round robin against both Canada and Slovakia. Combines his long stride with very good stick-handling prowess and long reach. He is able to make time for linemates with his possessions. Extremely creative and shows finesse in his set ups, but more importantly his demeanor is such that he takes the responsibility of winning on his shoulders. He has a high upside, not a limited ceiling that some suggest. Can dominate down low and between the dots. Retrieves pucks by way of physical checks and honest wall work. There are no warts in his game, and he has shown in college games that he can play and dominate against older more developed young men. He isn't the fastest player from a dead start, but good enough in a straight line to fill holes, block shots, and position himself as a threat in more ways than one. There is no denying by any scout that the offensive skills are there, and will grow. No growth is necessary as a team guy and possible future NHL captain.
