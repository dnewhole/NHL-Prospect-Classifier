217,2018,Eric_Florchuk,"Big Centre-wing whose feet have improved radically in the course of the season. He has improved his skating stride's length to accommodate his longer legs. Very light on his edging and a creative stickhandler. Mystifies defenders and finds his passing outlets after rolling off coverage when his scoring chance closes. Pushes opponents off pucks on the forecheck and any place where he can jump in and can leverage. Hockey smarts and fearless in traffic, has a coasting gear. Really controls the attack zone looks. Far from a finished product as he still needs work in many areas. There is is plenty of upside. He sprouted up a few inches and needs time to fill out.",Washington,False,0.5184965690023953
206,2018,Radim_Salda,"Thin mobile defender with good size and skill. Second year eligible. Smart with his carries and puck movement. Strong power play point shot. Pinches in well in the attack zone, and battles hard for puck possession on the wall. His attack skills are rapidly progressing. Good skater but isn’t accomplished at taking his skating ability and using it to improve his play. He will stop moving his feet when taking on rushing defenders. He will drift out of position in his own zone when the opposition has possession, and seems easily manhandled in front of his own net.",Tampa Bay,False,0.5177948114496382
205,2018,Marcus_Westfalt,"Big winger who played for the first time in the top SHL. He is a large kid who shows a willingness to bull to the front and and displays in many instances, strong lean while along the boards in the battle areas. A good skater who has jump enough to come out of the corner separated from his check and thus becoming a dangerous target or shooter. When the season started everyone jumped on the bandwagon, extolling his attributes.

Possibly the youngest project in the draft class. He needs more girth, strength, and skating development to be able to improve the power in his stride. Improving his feet will make the difference to whether he is really a prospect or not. There are no complaints on his commitment on the sheet, where he works so hard for sixty minutes.

He needs to get stronger to take on opponents and must read and react better so his passes aren’t anticipated. He is a good puck handler who makes sound exits in transition when he has time.

Displays a really nice first step and terrific edge control. That allows him to patiently slip into seams, stop start on a dime, skate to passes, and surprise in the scoring areas. Not the fastest skater, but has a good pace every shift. Really good shooter on the move, and very good at handling the puck in small spaces. High energy motor, diagnoses, and with his compact stride - catches teams whether he shoots or makes pass that they don’t expect.

A dynamic tracking force on offense and aggressive forechecker who unearths pucks. Was slowed by ankle injury he incurred at the World Junior U-20.

Far from ready to be considered NHL worthy, as he has zero interest in getting dirty in physical games.

No flash, just a really strong on his skates player who is really solid in his own end. Blocks shots, clears the front, and plays the body with regularity and some snarl. Is starting to show progress as an offensive zone player displaying a cannon from the back end. Has shown more confidence in jumping up in the play.

Passes the puck well and has good hands under pressure. He plays with some edge and tries to let the opposition know he is out there. Untapped offensive potential due to his hockey IQ, hands, and stick. Scored 11 goals and 35 points in the open QMJHL, so that leads me to think there is upside as an attacker too. Big solid junior defender who projects as a guy a team takes and develops. Displays good play-making ability and balance. His skating is a work in progress. He is good straight ahead, but you want more agility and better pivots in setting his gaps.

He closes the gap to contact. Very instinctive, smart in his reads and understanding of his position. Has an active stick always disrupting the passing lanes. Positions himself so he always seems to have leverage on the competition to take them off the biscuit. Transitions out of his end well, and also passes the puck out well.

Needs to get much stronger, bulk up, and needs to be a 60 minute dominant attacker. So far, his dynamic offense shows, but seems to fade and disappear. He sometimes plays so fast that his take-ways leave his line mates in the dust behind the play. Learning to use his speed, create space, and let plays percolate are what need developing, along with upper body strength.

He does have a nice stride that keeps him next to his man in coverage and able to win pucks away. Effective on the penalty kill in the Five Nations tournament.

After transition in his own end, he uses his partner for d-to-d pass and clears his zone effectively with solid outlet passes. Really long-armed and has soft hands with passes and receptions as he moves up ice. Effective and creative with cross ice feeds, jumps up driving the play into the attack zone. This big man reads the offensive end as smart as anyone. Arguably, was the best Swedish player in the Five Nations Tourney. There is long term potential in his selection because he is a player who showed tonnes of improvement in his footwork, and over all agility.

There are serious questions as to whether he can fill a NHL top six role because he simply hasn’t shown very much scoring prowess.

He is a good passer but you can’t help but notice he wants to hold on to the puck, come into the attack zone, and be the difference maker. He stands out on the power play or whenever his team is in attack mode. Gets a lot of power behind his heavy shot. Easily slips down to soft areas, receive pucks, and take shots between the dots -- and he loves to do it. Uses his skating ability as an asset when being a defender. Harnesses his balance and smooth stride to get there to seal attackers off to the wall, closes gaps quickly, and close soft spots by filling them. Willing to use his size to step up and into opponents, and will clear the front. He won’t seem anything but calm in his own end, even when you may think he need to be. The wild colt aspect about so many of this draft classes defenseman has been noted so much already, but this is yet another player who seems less inclined to play conservatively by holding back in transition. He wants to make the clean entry by his lonesome and is good at it! He wants to get the transitioned pucks and go back down so he can see the defending goalie's eyes -- then score. It is this all-in, I'm-gonna-win-it-for-us play. Many times it comes back and hurts his team, but there is so much to like about his abilities. Projects as a possible top 2 pairing NHLer whom you cannot deny on the carries. Takes chances to be the difference maker. There is high upside if he continues to grow his all around game. I know I would select him. Big physical blue line presence with keen two-way game and skill set. Displays big time physicality that sets the tone. A terrific skater with a booming shot.

The comparison with past Q big forward Julien Gauthier stops right here; this giant wing has quick hands and some lateral ability, that separates him significantly. His long reach coupled with his long legged fluidity let’s him cover lots of ice in a shift. Goes to the net and has physical tools that might lead him to a strong NHL career.

The first 15 year old granted exceptional status to play in the QMJHL and is in his third season in the “Q.”  Due to nagging injuries in his second season, his point totals were less than his rookie adjustment season. Draft prognosticators and his St. John Seadogs team were looking for big things this season, but he didn’t seem to be taking a qualitative jump as a dominant scorer. A change of scenery with a trade to Drummondville gave him a bit of a fresh start. Through the middle of March he still hadn’t reached the 20 goal mark but contributed more than 50 assists and has generated offense. No one can argue with his hockey IQ, sense, composure, and poise, or his commitment to being a 200 foot centre. He displays a good strong skating stride, and two step quickness at times. He’s got the size and will to compete. Reads the ice like a vet, can pass off and exchange the puck smoothly. Fearless and tough, he usually keeps an even keel -- but he's not going to be a intimidated. At this point, he's more of an offensive generator than high end scorer. The essential question is whether he has demonstrated elite level offensive skills and shooting ability to projects him as more than a complimentary offensive forward.

Uses his defensive partner well when he goes ""d to d."" Probably a bit under-rated on the offensive side. A quick ""touch and pass"" player in the offensive zone who gets the puck to his own open attackers. Will pinch down along the wall much to the chagrin of the opposition, trying to gain possession. This young man, named after martial artist, displays Jet Li core strength, and relished contact in compact space. He seems the winner in each and every physical confrontation. Besides being a devastating contact player that instills enough respect that opponents try to avoid hit hits, he has a very quick stick, breaking up passes in both the neutral and defensive zones. Unheralded offensively at this juncture, he reads and finds teammates on their way to passing lanes. Displays smarts and patience when at the top of the umbrella on the power play.

A wild colt that doesn’t hesitate to take on entrance into the attack zone, he somewhat ignores his linemates. Confident he can stickhandle and flash though to start the attack zone looks. Part of his bronco-like behaviors spills out with an attitude that rubs many the wrong way. He has really good vision and is an offensive leader with his carries, passes, and lateral movements -- creating space in the offensive zone. Has little trouble seeing that open man at the other blue line and can thread the needle with the breakaway pass. He is physically strong and aggressive. Really good puck distributer in the attack-zone. Another of the valuable right-handed shooting defenders teams covet. The downside is (as is with so many of the undersized fast and skilled attacking defenseman): he is a liability as defenseman -- pure and simple. It’s not so much that the riverboat gambler mentality is the cause of his defensive shortcomings either. He doesn’t seem to understand coverage or read the attacking teams. He puts himself in many situations were he has to play undisciplined and garnishes unwanted penalties. The scouting staff of team drafting in that third tier range will have to watch tons of tape and decide if the good outweighs the bad. You can teach defense whereas you cannot teach the high end skills he possesses. I am sure the team that selects him will have a scheme to protect him in his end, and move forth from there.

At times looks like an outstanding developmental prospect who can send the opposition reeling by going to the front and driving through traffic. Has a good hockey IQ and excellent vision. With his high end passing ability teams are viewing him as a really nice late first round option. His soft hands thread the needle with the best of them, when dishing to his linemates with intensity by way of both his forehand and backhand. When he shows inspired play in traffic between the dots, he is moving and shooting with regularity. The issue is the consistency at which he displayed these efforts. Can look disinterested and not willing to get involved for long stretches. Teams look towards the prospects that come to play sixty minutes, even if they may have less skill than many who don't play up to there potential. But teams also hope to change hearts and minds as maturity takes place. For me, this young German lad is a toss-up.",St. Louis,True,0.6155888409216135
20,2018,Rasmus_Kupari,"Solid centre-wing with top end speed, a superb stride, and lateral agility. Why his name isn't being noted is puzzling as he is an aggressive knock'em-down-to-get-back-the-puck speedster who projects as an attacking left winger. His elite burst gets him in top gear very quickly and changes direction rapidly. Aggressively gets in for the forecheck, and will use his body to separate pucks from the opposition in the offensive zone. Creative in the attack zone, he makes nice feeds and is best when he has open ice to work in. Projects as a centre, but probably ends staying on the wing because he is not a high end stickhandler set up guy. Hands are quicker shooting than handling but can lose pucks in tight. Is able to cover lots of ice each shift, and does. He has an excellent shot. Needs to get better in his decision making, reads, and become a more consistent player. The fact he shuttled from Liiga, Junior A SM-liiga and Mestis and was asked to also shuttle between wing and centre didn’t help his progress. His lack of production this past year will see his draft value drop, but there is still much to like about this prospect.",Los Angeles,False,0.5570630089962714
19,2018,Jay_O'Brien,"A late bloomer with good skills, feet, and high end stickhandling ability. Six foot playmaking centre with very good offensive instincts and smarts. Has good vision and sees the open teammate quickly and effectively. Has a good anchor and is strong on the puck. Has a frame that can add weight. Has a terrific stick, and despite knocks on his skating stride by others, he provides scoring chances using his speed and agility. The issue is more if you are able to get value by where he is selected. His lack of production in past years is a troubling aspect if you see him as player who is going to trend upward. As an NHLer, he'll be expected to contribute as a regular contributor offensively. Committed to Providence College.",Philadelphia,True,0.5789128409524567
17,2018,Ty_Smith,"The biggest differences between this undersized, fast, and skilled offensive defender, and the players surrounding him in the rankings is that he's a left shot and is a very responsible in his own end. He already defends better than Boqvist and Hughes... despite his undersized frame. Another elite skater with terrific edge work and poise beyond his years. Needs to get thicker and stronger, but has learned to play nimble and smart against the bigger attackers. He handles the puck at a very high skill level and lights it on his stick. A tad under six foot and about 175 pounds, he manages to elevate his game and play a solid 200 foot game despite his limitations. Before February 1st he was at a point per game pace in the Dub. A character player, offensive generator, and PP QB.",New Jersey,True,0.5307350302115463
22,2018,K'Andre_Miller,"Converted forward who is a large physical defense-first defender who is nearly 200 pounds. Very good in motion as a puck carrier, can shoot the puck as a point man or when he activates as part of the attack. Uses his size to and length against attackers and lets the opposition know he is there near the blue paint. Responsible in his end, makes sound decisions, a good outlet pass, but gets in trouble with his stop/starts, or when caught not moving. Passes well in all phases and reads his end well, using his teammates on the way out. Will let his big shot go while pressing in the attack zone and opens up with a hard fast one-timer.  Still learning the nuances of the backline and is quite smart at trying to do things as simple as possible at this point. As he improves his feet, he might gain more assertiveness going up ice through the middle zone with zone enrties. At this point projects as a bottom four defender. Committed to the University of Minnesota.",NY Rangers,False,0.6860959351309379
15,2018,Grigori_Denisenko,"Russian playmaking winger with excellent on-ice vision, high-end hands and stick. Was the best player at the World Junior A Challenge. Projects as a high end scorer, but will need to be less generous with the puck on the attack to actually turn into a big time scorer. Is such a good precise passer and his stop/starts are so clean he gains time to diagnose which teammate should receive his pinpoint pass. He has high end dangle and deception skills, and seems to be able to take games over. At very least looks to me a cut above everyone else on the ice sheet. And this isn't a Vladimir Tarasenko; ready and willing to work on the back end, no quit when the tide is running strong against him. He isn't a 100% each shift guy and can sour you by what seems to be disinterest at times. He has got that same Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde you saw in Alexander Semin, so there is lots to consider with this prospect. The real key when selecting Russians who aren't already over in North America is they may not want to make the jump  under the rookie salary cap constraints; they can make plenty of money while staying at home and waiting until the teams that draft them are no longer subject to the entry-level contract rules. Sometimes these Russian players slip into the later parts of the selection process unless they plan to come now and stay -- no matter if they make the parent clubs right away.",Florida,True,0.6464771471800305
14,2018,Joel_Farabee,"Smart three zone playmaker with an abundance of excellent characteristics and tools that point him upward as a solid NHL winger. Presently a six foot lightweight (well under 170lbs) who has high end awareness, terrific shift to shift work ethic, and simply makes plays all over the sheet. Playing against same age competition, he easily grades out as above-average. A strong balanced skater who effectively masks his skating gears. He causes opponents issues when he has the puck and on defense when he has any chance of gaining it back. When he does make things happen, he diagnoses and makes a well laid quick pass to cause sudden momentum changes the other way. His hockey IQ tips the scale in his favor, whether he is playing against a tight defensive opponent, in a fast pace back-and-forth barn stormer, or when things get chippy. A really good penalty killer, and might be on the ice during any situation. Excellent with the puck on his stick, strong and quick to find and use his options. Has a good release; as he gets stronger, I am sure his shot will get heavier. Fearless and relentless attacker, who creates time and space to advance pucks to his linemates or cut through traffic with an accurate surprise shot. Some might argue that being on the USNTDP first line with scorer Oliver Wahlstrom has help him standout, but I think that the argument also works in the opposite direction, as this kid is a non-stop offensive generator who wills wins with his high energy commitment to victory. What teams will have to do is project just where he fits in a pro line-up. Is there upside as the competition ramps up? Or does the team that selects him come away happy they are getting a NHL package, that can be a complimentary piece as opposed to dominant first line force? Committed to Boston University.",Philadelphia,True,0.7712140786323842
23,2018,Isac_Lundestrom,"While still being eligible for the draft class, that didn't stop him from centering the first line of Sweden's World Junior Tournament silver medal winning team. Dependable, reliable and responsible are what scouts thought a year ago, and only solidified that opinion this season with strong work in the faceoff circle. Decent use of his size, skating ability and smarts while on the ice. Very versatile as he can line up at any of the three forward positions, the power play, and  penalty kill. Works hard, drives the net, pressures the opposing defensemen, and creates turnovers. Drives to the net, and is decent in the defensive zone. The team that takes him is making a safe selection based on his all-around attributes that point upward.",Anaheim,True,0.5021999901105678
18,2018,Liam_Foudy,"This kid will work his way up to being a solid third liner in the NHL. Where he gets selected is the big debate.  Displays great speed and balance and simply takes away time from defenders, wining most pucks. An athlete whose scoring should continue to improve. Was one of the better two-way scorers in the OHL by the end of the season.",Columbus,True,0.5232550059242909
11,2018,Oliver_Wahlstrom,"Big forward is one of the premier scorers in the United States Development Team. A big bodied, fluid skating attacker who is apt at carrying the on zone entries. He finds time and space while carrying the puck and has a good wall presence. Creatively generates offense to his teammates. Is able to play all three forward position (although he hasn't been asked to play in the pivot position) and is very comfortable as an off-handed wing. Has shown high end shooting ability and has the goals to prove it. Slips into the soft areas and gets the one-timers. Has a really fine trigger, whether it is from the periphery, or when he is given looks in-closer to use his wrist shot. His speed and shot are usually the first two mentions he gets, but his vision, and creativity rank high, despite his shoot-first mentality at the amateur level.  Has been on the radar as a top U.S prospect for some time, so with that has been many views and scouts tend to see him as an established “reliable” prospect. Not some new best thing, so he may last a bit longer than expected if teams don’t see him as a top scoring centre prospect. I see him as an NHL left winger who needs to add more edge, finish checks, and provides two way play starting in your top six with decent upside towards it.",NY Islanders,True,0.5147862120728991
16,2018,Martin_Kaut,"High-end skater with top end speed, separation, and skills. Uses his elite puck handling and stick skills to blow out of his defensive zone, and will back up the defenders when he quickly gets to attacking zone blueline. Lethal shooter who can target the corners, jump on the rebounds and even deflect shots from the point. Has a deceptive way of stick-handling and disguises when he releases his shots. Will use defenders as screens in the process. Very imaginative in his strategies and passes. There is much to like, but seems a bit disinterested in his own end and when his team gets behind or out-matched.",Colorado,False,0.5520036787482467
13,2018,Ty_Dellandrea,"Displays excellent skill set, good size and giddy-up. Wins puck battles and is responsible in his own end. Has a strong two-way game. Moves well with deceptive quickness. Has been stuck on Flint with no help for two seasons. If the World Juniors Under-18 showed us anything, it was that he quickly meshed with different line-mates and outworked the opposition night after night. Grinds away whether it be keeping pucks alive on the offense or with dogged forechecking to turn the puck over.  Excellent vision and playmaking ability. A developing player who makes it easy for his wingers and is still blossoming as a scorer.",Dallas,True,0.6099597678458673
8,2018,Adam_Boqvist,"This draft will be marked with an unprecedented number of highly sought after skilled attacking defensemen who are average or under-sized with little physicality. This player compensates for it with terrific hands and ability to push the pace, doing a decent job in his own end using his skill set. In the Swedish junior league, Boqvist showcased a nice shot, high end speed, and agility. He may very well be the top finesse and fine-edge-skating defenseman in the draft, displaying great balance and lateral mobility. He is lightning fast and has great vision. He distributes the puck unselfishly and he jumps in on the attack -- sometimes leading it. He opens up and delivers a very accurate one timer. As a slight, smaller player, he gets overtaken, losing puck battles to the bigger players. Does show good vision in both ends but it is a bigger challenge in his own end. His fast feet help negate some of his problems in the defensive zone, but it is difficult to ignore his defensive zone positioning issues. As a lightweight anchor, he needs to fill out, get stronger, and build his defensive game. Another right handed shooting mobile defenseman.",Chicago,True,0.6013065425427503
7,2018,Quinn_Hughes,"Undersized defender in the Kris Letang mold who plays strong at both ends. This Michigan Wolverine had a very successful freshman season as an undersized offensive defenseman. About five foot ten, he has one of the highest hockey IQ in this class. Moreover, he is one of the fastest and most agile skaters at his position with the jump to not only get to top gear rapidly, but gear down to a complete stop to reverse or change direction -- slowing down the ice and controlling the play with the ""freeze."" He has been heralded for years as a player destined to be selected in the top couple selections. He displays elite feet, balance and edge work. He wants the puck on his stick on zone entries and even chooses to skate the puck solo when the puck transitions to him in his defensive zone. He is so fast that he is able to jump in on the attack on most offensive forays. Always looking for the dynamic pass to set up a goal, the competitive nature in all zones is terrific and fearless. The team that drafts him knows he will use his stick positioning, feet, and lateral quickness to defend, and will fall short against stronger bigger attackers who will win the majority of physical confrontations. A team drafting him will have to devise a plan to protect him in his end, maybe even pull back the reins.",Vancouver,True,0.5302831942428665
6,2018,Filip_Zadina,"At six foot and 190, he is a dynamic scoring wing who just keeps getting scoring chances-- and capitalizes on them. Solid skater with lateral agility, but he isn’t a blazer, so he exploits the seams & soft spots in coverage. Displays quick hands and a scorers mentality, but doesn’t necessarily use his agility as a one trick pony in the attack zone. He is responsible in all three zones and is competitive in backside pressure. His forte is on the power play; he is able to generate chances, get to soft areas, and use his head and hands to shoot the puck. Has a wicked one-timer, and a quick release - cannon of a snap shot. Has been an elite attacker in the QMJHL. Very patient and has a smart sense about where he should be in the attacking zone. He can beat you with a surprising heavy perimeter shot, or simply gets in closer and sniffs around for scores in the area. Seems to swoop into existing puck battles and come out untouched, quickly moving into the blue dot. He makes the goalie start changing his position and takes advantage with his sneaky backhand or quick wrister. He lit up the World Juniors U-20 for Czech with seven goals in seven games at 18 years of age. He has emerged as one of the top picks in the class because his fiery offensive capabilities may continue to develop into the pro game. And I don't think moving him to left wing compromises his ability to score and make plays. A pure shooter, who can change a game with one flick of his wrists..",Detroit,True,0.5995473978196166

A complete player who takes pride in his 200 foot game, has high hockey IQ, and solid playmaking ability in the attack zone. He has little trouble finding and feeding his best option in the offensive zone. Plays both PK and PP. Three inches smaller than Jordan Staal -- a player he compares to nicely. There is plenty to like about him in terms of his commitment and continuing improvement. You draft him knowing he doesn’t project as a top line impact center; just a guy the coach will love because he can play in all situations and slide in anywhere in the bottom nine and make the guys around him better. Selfless, serious, high IQ guy in the offensive end, drawing more than one attacker to him, only to deceptively get the puck to an open teammate. He is a scoring threat every shift with his heavy shot, but isn’t gonna wow you. He quietly and effectively gets his job done in all three zones or with his snap shot.",Arizona,True,0.7566878881892894
9,2018,Vitali_Kravtsov,"A big winger with very good straight line speed, balance, quick feet, and scoring ability. While his numbers in the KHL were nothing to take notice of, the fact that he was on the first team power play says much for how he is thought of. He still needs to make use of his linemates, understand how to use his speed as a device to set up the five man attack, and needs to keep adding strength. Plays aggressive, hard, and with grit, projecting as a power forward. A creative three zone player who was able to impose his will and be on equal footing with grown men in the KHL. He will only get stronger and more dynamic.  There certainly is enough there for teams to consider him as a highly skilled prospect that wouldn't be available late in the first...",NY Rangers,True,0.5122501627411924
10,2018,Evan_Bouchard,"Big impact defender who some have categorized as a power play specialist, although I think that is understating his overall game and upside. Has been at the top or close to the top in defenseman scoring this entire year in the OHL. He was named captain of his club, and plays really smart in both ends. Has good balance and good four-direction skating ability, despite not being categorized as an agile lateral mover with a big burst up ice. Thinks the game at an elite level, and in March was leading his team in scoring. Has little problem getting involved up ice on the rush and is very comfortable using his skill set and decision-making to create from the blue line. He has an excellent hard point shot, but always looks for the best pass too. Skates a bit upright, but it doesn’t hamper his vision or coolness in his own end and when things are starting to develop on the offensive. The sport has reached a skill level where there is a division that separates the position of defenseman into two distinct type styles, and at this point, Bouchard falls into the ""has decent size and power, but lacks that lightning speed"" side. Still developing, he projects as a right-side backline leader who continues to grow his game to where he achieves high pair NHL status.",Edmonton,True,0.5242162568023516
12,2018,Noah_Dobson,"Plays both ends of the ice very well. Has a good frame and will continue to grown into it and get bigger, and surely he will become less shy playing like a larger guy. Already better then most “Q” defenders at using his mobility, reach, stick, and to have his stick on the right side of the puck carrier. Deceptively fast and always willing to lug the biscuit up ice. Because he is bigger and his stride is so fluid, he catches you off guard with how fast he can accelerate and then surprises again when he executes at top speed. Jumps up from the blue line deep in to the attack zone and has the speed to get himself back up ice. Has a slapper he keeps low and a strong accurate wrist shot. You would like a bit more physicality and see him push attackers off the puck. While he shows he can separate players from the puck decently although, they won’t be looking to see if he is coming next shift. Has already shown enough to be considered a top half of the first round candidate, but I have concerns he might not have the elite quickness and ""head"" speed to become a top NHL impact defenseman.",NY Islanders,True,0.6111505664170277
