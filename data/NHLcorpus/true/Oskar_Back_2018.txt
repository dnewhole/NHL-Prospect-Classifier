Big Swedish forward with a good two-way game, face-off ability. Good vision, handles the biscuit well and can create offense. Needs to improve balance, bursts, and skating agility, and also start using his size as an advantage. Not a high end creator as he lacks first step quickness, and lateral agility. But, he can always pull it off.
