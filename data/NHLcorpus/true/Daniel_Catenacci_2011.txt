Undersized fireball with great stick skills, superb vision, and speed.  Every time he steps on the ice he reminds me of the when Lou Angotti was thrown on the ice for a short shift, and he relentlessly went full speed the entire time, trying to make an explosive impact. He was able to since he was taking not a regular shift. You have to wonder how effective this lad would be as the level of competition rises and everyone naturally moves at a higher quickness level.
