Is he your future power winger or your big centre? He can be such high end puck hander and a tank-like aggressive force with his work in the crease area. He can also defend away from the puck, or be so strong on the puck. But surely when he was finally elevated to first line centre in the U-18 Worlds, he showed a high end potential. Did that now project him as a forceful, physical future NHL centre? The fact that he is very proficient in the face-off circle might have NHL scouting staffs figuring he should get ample chances to develop as a pivot. Strong on his skates in his possessions and very effective on the defensive side. Needs a step to get going and is straight line attacker, but is patient and sneaky with a good wrist shot, and possesses the ability to gift-wrap pucks to teammates. The team that drafts him will be hopeful he continues to build leg strength and fill in fully. Lots to like about his vision and hockey smarts and upside.
