Each player that was granted early entrance exceptional status into Canadian junior leagues are heaped with platitudes and criticized through strong microscopes. Continue up the ladder to the NHL takes a larger developmental commitment for a defensive prospect than a forward. Sean day has done little to justify he is exceptional except for gaining the tag as the most over-rated prospect in the OHL. If you are unclear on his history, his family and representation demanded he be let into the CHL early, based on his size, skating and skills coming up through Detroitâ€™s Compuware -16 program. He has what amounts to a terrible season on and off the ice. He was sent home in December for attitude problems and requested a trade out of Mississauga. There were rumors that his camp was trying to force a trade to one specific junior team, London. The Steelheads refused to blink, and he remains their player. Despite all the ego and issues, the CHL invited him to the CHL Prospects Game. His size skills skating and shot have not rounded into a player and now have taken a backseat to the rest of his story.
