Son of Juha, who played five seasons with Phoenix and other NHL teams. A slight six foot winger with really good acceleration, agility, and top gears. Nimble in small space and can pivot to change direction, creating space in the process. Sees the ice well, and usually knows which option to hit with the puck. A work in progress. He needs to get much bigger/stronger. In doing so, he'll be less likely to get knocked off the puck, play with more jam, and have better judgement in his decisions under pressure.
