A skilled first year forward formally of MJHL Championship Portage, where he helped them to their second straight league championship, and then came oh so close to playing in the RBC Cup â€“ the national championship for junior A hockey. A sturdily built six footer clicked early with his veteran linemates. He is playmaker who likes to cycle the puck down low and has a good shot. Sees the ice well and is creative with the puck, generating scoring chances. Hard working and disciplined. A longer term development guy who will work to improve his top foot speed and all around game.
