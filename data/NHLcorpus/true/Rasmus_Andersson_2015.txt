He was selected to the roster for the World Junior Under-18 Tournament in April, 2013 as a player almost two years younger than the rest, save Connor McDavid. An impact type blue-liner who has tremendous vision, and instincts. Heavy shooter who can lead the rush, or guide it from the backline. Superb passer who leads many of the transitional rushes. Smooth strong skater who is positionally very strong and able to read and adjust in his zone, along with his ability to contribute offensively. Strong and thick already, he will work on quickness and defensive side of the game. Another intriguing Swedish hopeful who was on the radar very early, maybe due to the fact his Father is a former NY Ranger and has had an older brother already selected. He is another early touted player that hasnâ€™t continued to rise from his early press billings. Extremely poised and gifted as a puck carrier and distributor, due to excellent vision and touch, but seems to have not regained his early swagger in his possessions. This is his first year in the OHL, and had a season in the Swedish Allsvenskan the year before. Needs to stay patient but also not overplay his possessions. Needs a whole lot more snark and physicality in his own end, and if he can add that to his already strong tools as a puck-carrier and PP guy, he may get his name called early.
