Big Russian import who has really improved the pace at which he plays in all phases. Rangy defender with footwork, who can transport through the neutral zone in a few strides. Strong on the puck as he protects it well whenever he is in possession. Uses his size to take back pucks and disturb attackers.  Polished enough to not hold the biscuit too long, and uses his soft hands to get it tape to tape to teammates. Displays a really low heavy power play point shot, that can be targeted for deflecting. His long reach helps pull in errant pass returns, and he keeps the puck moving emblematic of the new era role of the backliners.
