Import player who seems to have all the offensive skills to be a very successful NHL down the road. Undeniable weapon who can dangle, set up and score, putting defenders on their heals. Sneaks into the soft areas and lets go with a lethal shot. Lost in his own zone, and needs plenty more strength and commitment to be a better back-end player. The fact that Ilya Kovalchuk walked away from his NHL career to easily find a new buyer in the KHL further complicates the NHL decision in regards to drafting skilled Russian-born prospects, including those who have shown the willingness to come over in the season prior to their draft year.
