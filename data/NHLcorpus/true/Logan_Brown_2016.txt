Son of former NHLer Jeff Brown towers over the potential first round draft class at six foot five inches plus. He effectively uses his reach on the forecheck and to keep the puck away from the opposition. Besides having excellent vision and hockey sense, he is a above average stickhandler who handles the puck well. His size enables him to win puck battles and although his skating style is awkward, it is effective enough to help him gracefully moves into areas to create space  and open teammates. He has a decent shot which he needs to improve and actually use more frequently. Very effective down low, and holds onto pucks by using his size and reach, and is difficult to contain. He never looks out of place no matter what pace the game is moving at. He needs to shot more. he needs actually get more involved. I think observers tend to view big men like him as less urgent and a passenger. And we all want our big forwards to play hard and aggressive. He projects to be a NHL power scoring wing but to actually develop into that prototypical power forward he needs a few parts to his game.
