Aggressive pounding forward who played like a North American style winger for Sweden at the 2013 World Junior Under-18 Tournament. Heavy hitter who the opposition remembers. makes contact hard in corners and in front. Works the cycle well, because he gets room. Let's loose a heavy shot. Agitates. Handles the puck well in traffic and has good hands and feet.
