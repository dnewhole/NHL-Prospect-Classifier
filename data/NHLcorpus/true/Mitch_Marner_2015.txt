Has abundant skill, speed, agility, and quick hands that makes him a threat on every touch. A hard worker who uses his gifts as a relentless forechecker, attacker and scorer. Reads the play and is a good set up man besides being a 200 foot home run end to end attacker. Clearly not a kid man but still is willing to attack the front, work the corners and engage with the enemy whenever necessary. He works hard to get pucks back, no matter the price. Great combination of hand-eye-feet speed and edging that set him apart from most of the others in the Canada Under-18 camp. His strength is his great lateral agility and ability to keep possession through countless defenders, read the options, and then place a soft pass on to a teammateâ€™s stick.
