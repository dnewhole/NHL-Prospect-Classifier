Lanky defender who has great poise and vision, but his biggest strength is his all compass skating ability which allows him to explode on defenders, pivot on a dime and crossover as effortlessly as most skaters go forward. Glides laterally on the blueline to wait for a shooting lane to open.   Committed to Western Michigan University.
