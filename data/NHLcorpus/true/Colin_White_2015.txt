Possesses average size, but high end skills and smarts. Opportunistic scorer who can make plays at high speed with some edge. Moves well laterally, and has a quick stick to control loose pucks, and cause turnovers. Anticipates the pass and needs little time to unload his big-time shot. Possesses a quick release and superb accurancy with his shots. Top player on US Under-17 Team in the past. A solid forechecker and responsible two-way centre. Pressures the opposition and steals pucks that he quickly turns into scoring opportunities. Very strong on the puck because of his solid skating and balance. Projects as a NHL point producer.
