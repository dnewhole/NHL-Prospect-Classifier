A responsible up and down centre-wing with excellent skating ability and feel for the attack zone. He is smart with the puck and his soft mitts allow him to hit linemates on the move, or put his hard shot on the net.  Finds the open space and creates scoring chances. Has an extra gear that he can hit to get to that scoring lane. Is a patient puck-handler who can slow things down in order to break them open. Needs more credit for being a finisher, as he really can score, even though he is always willing to use his feet and then send a soft pass to a teammate. Not a hard nosed wall player but will engage. Smooth skating winger with soft hands and good instincts. His deceptive stride shows excellent acceleration which he uses to get by pairs of defenders and able to get of quality chances. When he shows more edge, intensity and activity in the high traffic areas we will be sold. Like so many youngsters, his defensive game is a work in progress. He does come back. He needs to get more overall strength and when that comes he will be not only more able to be physical but also an even stronger puck carrier. Was named to the USA Developmental team playing in the Ivan Hlinka Tournament the last two years . Was named to the U.S. World Junior A roster for the Junior A Challenge. Committed to the University of Michigan.
