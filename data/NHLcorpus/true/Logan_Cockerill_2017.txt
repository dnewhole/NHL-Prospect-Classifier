Undersized wing with high end skill and breakaway speed. A relentless puck pursuer who ranks as one of the best skaters (speed and acceleration) in the class. Backs defender because the fear he will beat them one on one, if they close the gap. Always in motion and generating chances. Committed to Boston University.
