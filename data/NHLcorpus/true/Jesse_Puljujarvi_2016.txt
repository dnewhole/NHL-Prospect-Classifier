Top true Euro forward in the 2015 class is a Finn born in Sweden who has been playing in the  Finnish elite league since he was 16. Elite size, speed and shot. Uses his size to out-muscle opponents and has a deadly shot he is unafraid to use repeatedly. Some would argue that being scoring leader at the World Junior Tourney was a coming out party but he has established himself as a strong player in most phases of the game in the Finnish Pro league. Paired with Patrik Laine as bookend wings for his regular centre in Kärpät , Sebastian Aho, both solidified their status as early selections. I have him with on edge of Laine based on how strong a finisher Puljujärvi is down low. Jesse is a very strong skater and although doesn't appear as a dominant scoring threat shift after shift, he gets his chances and moreover he makes his line one that it is difficult to get scoring chances on. He stays involved shift after shift: He acts as a huge screen. He has terrific hands and a attack zone work tools, including an explosive burst, and smart two-way game. Still not as fluid or as offensively polished to challenge as the draft's top forward, but this RW has abilities that project him to turn into an excellent pro.
