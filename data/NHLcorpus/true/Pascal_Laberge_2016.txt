He wowed all with his opportunistic goal scoring in the Prospects game.Quick, agile forward with terrific stop/starts, change of direction and solid offensive instincts which make him dangerous in many ways in the attack zone. Decisively attacks with quick shots, passes, and even uses the enemy goalerâ€™s pads to generate rebounds. A character individual who has handled real life adversity in the lats years, as he has had to carry the heavy emotion load of family sicknesses and losses. Plays quick. He is a work in progress as he needs to add weight and muscle to his 160 pound frame.
