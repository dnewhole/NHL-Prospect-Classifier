Son of Claude Lemieux. Not fancy, just a big meat and potatoes North-South wing who can get going a bowl over the defenders on the way. Very thick and still developing strength, but a fearless and always ready combatant if it is necessary. Always good in his end taking pucks back on the wall and safely getting them to the proper outlet. A developing player who may rise up the charts as a first rounder if he continues to show he has the makings of a power forward. And in his past two junior playoff years, he seemed to elevate his game when the chips were down.
