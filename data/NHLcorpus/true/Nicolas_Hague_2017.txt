Potential big defender in more ways than one. NHL teams continue to have their love affair with huge men at the defensive position who have upside to be top four defenders, since in general the Dmen are getting smaller. For a fellow his size, he has excellent mobility and overall strength. He puts his long stick in the passing lanes and covers ground pretty quickly. Uses his size along the wall and can throw devastating bodychecks. When on the back pedal, he doesn't pivot as quickly as smaller men, but attackers trying to go wide find out how strong he is and how long his stick is. Enjoys playing with an edge. He is growing more of his offensive game, by activating on the rush, and attempting to handle the puck more and more. Still needs work and must hone his carries and be more frugal in the time he holds onto it. Not a finished product, but there will not be a shortage of NHL teams considering him before the bottom third of the first round.
