Has top-end hand-eye coordination to compliment his elusive speed and mobility. Has several gears and uses them in all three zones to attack and take pucks away. He is getting bigger, which will help his draft status since he isn't afraid of battle areas, contact, or moving through traffic. His top speed lets him break away to the outside, and come back to the front of the net. He created more notice after a nice showing in August at both the Ivan Hlinka tourney and the NHL RDO camp. His scoring skills must continue to grow. He is a rounded three-zone responsible guy and smart set up man. He does need to get a heavier gun, as his shot needs work. In a year with forwards taking a back step to defenseman, he may prove a worthy selection at forward. His current pace of production has seen him lag behind in the assist and scoring columns, and that may suggest there is less offensive upside than thought. The pro game now is dependent upon a strong forecheck which he is very capable of providing. He needs to have better puck handling. He takes the puck into dirty areas though to attempt to score, not just settling as a perimeter shooter.
