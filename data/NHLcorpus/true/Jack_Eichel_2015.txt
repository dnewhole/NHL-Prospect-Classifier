The US born centre may not be as good as the top guy but he sure looks like a generational player in his own right. He is a quick off the face-off circle skater who can jump onto defender can get pucks before they know it. A power player who could also project to wing, because he has tremendous jump, balance and punch when he engages. So light on his edges, with a powerful long stride, and a really long reach, he is beyond dangerous with the puck. Finds himself the open spaces. Can enter and exit the face-off circle with the the puck and ramp to high gear and let it go as quick as the best. Reads situations and can go end to end like the 200 foot player he is. Plays centre and is very good there, but his quick release and wall work might have teams projecting him as a attack winger too. He is a lunchpail team player with impact player toolbox. He was selected to the roster for the World Junior Under-18 Tournament in April. Already committed to Boston University where he began with strong goal and point totals from the onset. There's no doubt in my mind he could dethrone McDavid, based on his all-around smarts and play. So many of the recent early first rounders are kept on the NHL rosters because the braintrust think they better off developing there, and giving the fans a look at what might be coming. In Eichel's case, you will see him take a top centre role away from someone, because he is a game-changer from shift one. A member of his homelandâ€™s team roster for the World Junior Under-20 at Christmas 2014.
