A member of his homelandâ€™s team roster for the World Junior Under-20 at Christmas 2014, the lanky wing who is a good skater with good speed and nice acceleration. A good back checker. Displays average hands and his skill projects him to possibly be a bottom six player, when he fills out and improves his balance. Has some qualms about going into the battle zones on the attack, and does rush things when he gets the biscuit. More of a perimeter shooter who needs to learn patience and better control of the puck in the attack zone. Is strong in puck pursuit but just not overly aggressive, physical or creative. Long term potential wing who needs time and development.
