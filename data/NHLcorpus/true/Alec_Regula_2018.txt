Lanky defenseman with four direction skating ability, size, strength, and effective defensive zone prowess.  Maintains solid gaps, keeps his check funneled outside the middle, and is good in front at impeding attackers progress. Makes the first pass out, shows some creativity and smarts when he does venture in on the attack. The offensive end will surely come as he develops more confidence in what he can do.
