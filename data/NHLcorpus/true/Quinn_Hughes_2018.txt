Undersized defender in the Kris Letang mold who plays strong at both ends. This Michigan Wolverine had a very successful freshman season as an undersized offensive defenseman. About five foot ten, he has one of the highest hockey IQ in this class. Moreover, he is one of the fastest and most agile skaters at his position with the jump to not only get to top gear rapidly, but gear down to a complete stop to reverse or change direction -- slowing down the ice and controlling the play with the "freeze." He has been heralded for years as a player destined to be selected in the top couple selections. He displays elite feet, balance and edge work. He wants the puck on his stick on zone entries and even chooses to skate the puck solo when the puck transitions to him in his defensive zone. He is so fast that he is able to jump in on the attack on most offensive forays. Always looking for the dynamic pass to set up a goal, the competitive nature in all zones is terrific and fearless. The team that drafts him knows he will use his stick positioning, feet, and lateral quickness to defend, and will fall short against stronger bigger attackers who will win the majority of physical confrontations. A team drafting him will have to devise a plan to protect him in his end, maybe even pull back the reins.
