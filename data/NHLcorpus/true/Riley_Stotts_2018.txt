From mites to junior, he has been one of the more heralded players as he has excelled at each level. An elite skater with a strong burst who brings it every shift. Can dominate as an attacker with his very natural quick release. Finds the open creases on the attack. Will blow in, slide stop, and then have the space to surprise with a laser.  Fires right on net with screens and his speed is problematic when he cuts in -- freezing defenders. Did I mention he's good in the corners? Gives a solid defensive effort, and sneakily grabs and leans to impede the movement of the enemy. Looked really good in the CHL Prospects game.
