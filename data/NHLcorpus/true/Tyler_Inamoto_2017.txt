big character defender who plays well both ways but whose strength is in his grit and his ability to handle puck retrievals and make clean outlets in transition. He has good mobility and can be a punisher in his end. His overall attack zone skills aren’t overly evident, but he isn’t out of his comfort zone if given some PP time.
