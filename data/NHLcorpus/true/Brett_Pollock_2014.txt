Playing for a talented Oil Kings team, he is delegated to a third line role. He has nice size and skill and probably can play right wing as well. Good on the cycle, and the forecheck too. Consistent in all zones, and improving as an attacker. Tough and willing to shake things up with a big hit or by dropping the mitts. Long term prospect with upside.
