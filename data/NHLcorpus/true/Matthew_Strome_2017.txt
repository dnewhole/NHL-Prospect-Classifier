Will be the third brother drafted in the Strome family, but a bit of a different type of player than his more skilled older kin. He isn't as polished a skater as his brothers but makes up for it with a much more physical style of play, using his big body to create scoring chances, working the corners. He does possess a quick release, and displays patience in his carries. Displays high end hockey IQ, and gets to the front and scores. Very good in the cycle. The biggest deterrent to him being selected early is he has barely average foot speed and his pitiful off-the-mark acceleration. Needs to work on staying with his assignment in the defensive zone and not heading out before his team has established true possession. Today's NHL is a speed game, where even the big men are fleet afoot. Sure, with proper training and commitment, he will be able to improve in this area. The question is where in the slotting will a team make a selection of a player they know is in need of longer development and has a willingness to wait for him to come along?  In today's NHL, all twelve forwards skate and skate fast. They may be only 5' 8" , but they aren't a defensive liability numbers-wise. That is the rub on brother number three.
