Big framed developmental project with excellent reach, puck skills and a 200 foot game. A good skater who once in a specialized weight training program will gain power in his stride and get a lot bigger. That will make him even more of a problem when he sets up in front or battles along the wall. Already uses his reach, and works the wall fairly well. Committed to Ohio Stare University.
