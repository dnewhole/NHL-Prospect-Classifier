A third year eligible centreman who can create of the rush, compete down low and in the battle areas to win pucks and set up linemates,but don’t think that he isn’t a scorer as well and a mucker. The Stocky centre has a 200 foot game and can be a grinder, scorer, power play guy or a penalty-killing specialist. Strong first step quickness and deceptive tp end gear. Supports with speed in the defensive zone and that speed causes the opposition problems in the middle zone, and when he drives to the net. Under six feet but thick and over 190 pounds already. Has a strong work ethic and commitment to play three zones, and his leg drive let him do so as he is quick in all three. he has committed to the  University  of Denver .
