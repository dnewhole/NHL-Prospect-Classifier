High-motor, power center with size and soft hands. His two-way play, vision, crease presence, and corner work, along with good size and tools, make switching him to wing (where he has also played) an easy transition. He has some touch to his passing ability, but also has a heavy snapshot. He has good top gear, but his turns and skating need refinement as there is a hitch in his strides. A strong determined forechecker who finishes his checks. This kid looks like a willing-to-improve fireball who will make strides after a while in the bigs.
