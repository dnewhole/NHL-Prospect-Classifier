Diminutive OHL winger with a pinpoint accurate shot, a solid stride, quick feet , and both consistent and persistent efforts all over the sheet.  Was basically a walk-on…wasn’t drafted, just won himself a sweater by taking advantage of one scoring opportunity after another. He is a smart positional player, who is always around the puck, and battles, battles battles. The issue is he is 5’ 10” and 160. But will you bet against him?
