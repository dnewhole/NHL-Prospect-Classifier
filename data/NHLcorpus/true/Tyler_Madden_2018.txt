Son of John Madden, he is an undersized checking line wing with good feet and 200 foot commitment. Very hard forechecker who makes chances from the turnovers he causes. Has speed that aids him on the penalty kill too. Creates space and time with solid decisions. Must get more weight and strength because he gets overpowered off the puck at times.
