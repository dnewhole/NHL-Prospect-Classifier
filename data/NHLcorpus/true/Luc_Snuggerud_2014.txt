Unbridled offenseman who is a tremendous puck carrier with PP QB qualities, dangle, and transition skills. The question may be is just a riverboat gambler, or somewhat lacking in the IQ to understand situations and the ice to utilize team attack or does he disregard it to go one man show. Long term project with need of more strength and less predicability in his  attack skills.  Committed to the University of Nebraska-Omaha.
