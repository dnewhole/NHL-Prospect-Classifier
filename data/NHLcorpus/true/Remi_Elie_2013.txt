Quick physical wing who is a good developmental project at forward. In the OHL playoffs, he came through with goals and assists that may have lifted his upside, but nevertheless, has lots to learn about pace and coverage. Plays with a passion, but sometimes the lack of pace has him running around and then gassed. He displays some scoring prowess too. Will see more ice next year, and with it there are big hopes he develops further.
