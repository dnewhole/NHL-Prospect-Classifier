Sometimes it takes playing with great teammates to bring out the best in a prospect. Thats what transpired with this kid when he was surrounded by the cream of the Swedish d-man crop at the Under-18 Five Nations tournament. Very smart in his decisions, good vision and execution. There is so much to his game that translates to high levels of competition. He is confident, has very good speed, and plays with edge with big hits. Hard worker on the defensive wall and the battle areas. Has the feet to expertly jump up into the play and activate, sometimes being the entry guy. Really good hands too. Puts pucks on the sticks of the right teammate. Arguably might have played better than Adam Boqvist, Adam Ginning, and Filip Johansson, and was a revelation.
