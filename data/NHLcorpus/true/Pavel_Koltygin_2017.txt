Left winger with good offensive instincts, size and hands. Despite not being a great skater, he finds open ice and can let the puck go. Has a strong release on his wrister. Really didn’t get any support, because he played for a less than stellar QMJHL team. Doesn’t have any edge or physicality but is tough enough to take the hit to make the play. Is an very good stickhandler and beats defenders in the attack zone. Has improved his play aways from the puck but he needs to continue to improve his consistency and awareness in the defensive zone.
