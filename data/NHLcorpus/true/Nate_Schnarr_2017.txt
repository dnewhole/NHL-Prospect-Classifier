Big Centre-forward with a pro heavy wrist shot. Still getting comfortable with his size, he looks gangly but has nice North-South speed. Has above average hands but isnâ€™t an accomplished finisher. Has the tools and is a terrific competitor who gets in the passing lanes, blocks shots, and possesses a willingness to battle hard for the puck. He has a good skill level but needs time and coaching to round his game out into the sum of the parts.
