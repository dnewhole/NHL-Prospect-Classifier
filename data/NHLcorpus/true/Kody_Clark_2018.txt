Son of Maple leaf legend, Wendel. May not have much lateral agility and is a basic physical grind-it-out big-hitting winger with an edge. Moves North-South with a powerful stride with good lean and is very aggressive on the forecheck. Works hard as a guy who plays between the paint. Looks to disrupt and snap rebounds. Possesses a good wrist shot, plays strong on the puck. Works hard, but only has 18 goals and 39 points to show on his resume. A long term developmental player who needs more to his game.
