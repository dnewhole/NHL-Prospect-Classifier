200 foot centreman who needs a bit more girth, but he comes to play every game every shift, in all three zones. Really hockey smart, steady, and  instinctive in his own end. Despite not being the biggest guy, he will sacrifice his body to clear the defensive zone, or to try and get pucks in the attack zone.  A smart playmaker with a strong work ethic, good hands, and an obsession to get the loose pucks.
