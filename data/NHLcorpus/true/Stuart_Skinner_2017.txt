Big goaler with broad shoulders, long legs and a really wide stance. Has taken his game up a notch with less pre-shot "dancing"-he now relaxes, tracks, and lets the play come to him. Not great on his skates and only shows decent movement and at this juncture, looks stiff and deep in the net. But his size enables him to stay upright and close much of the open net without much movement. Uses his stick well to clear pucks from passes in front and his size lets him get from side to side in one easy motion. Long term developmental guy with upside. Put himself into second round consideration with and incredible playoff for Lethbridge.
