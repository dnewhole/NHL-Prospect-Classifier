 A knee injury placed him on IR for most of the season. Last season he was a guy who played both ends solid but not necessarily spectacular. Basically keeps it simple and safe, but his skating ability, hands and creativity have to get him noticed as a prospect with a much higher ceiling. A really good skater who is a long strider with the ability to second gear ago lateral on the offensive. He was just starting to show more creativeness in the attack before his got hurt. He has nice soft hands and receives passes well. Works the give and go well. Doesn’t panic in his own end and stays between attackers and his net. On the PP he sets up that half board one time with perfection. although we haven’t seen his emergence, there is lots to like about high upward mobility towards improvement.
