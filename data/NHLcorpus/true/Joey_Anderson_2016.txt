Thick under six footer whose squat muscular frame moves with power and jump. Very smart on the attack and the forecheck. Throws his wide body at the enemy, and unearths pucks, and makes good reads of his teammates and gets pucks on their stick blades with precision. Doesnâ€™t stand out as a hit end player, but just a very strong selfless complimentary attacker. Committed to the University of Minnesota- Duluth.
