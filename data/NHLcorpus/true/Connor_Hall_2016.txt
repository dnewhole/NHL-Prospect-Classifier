Solidly built showdown defenseman with good size and edge. Has good mobility and footwork, but projects as more of a stay at home defender who takes care of business protecting his teammates. Has really long arms and legs and is one of the bestl fist-fighter in the OHL. He isn't gonne join the rush, or push the pass in transition, just go back and get the puck and make the safe play out of the zone. He is best when he plays inside his comfort zone and makes those safe plays. Will get bigger and stronger.
