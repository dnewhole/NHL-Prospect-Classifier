Skilled physical center who combines good playmaking skills and an accurate shot with grit. Reliable face-off man, relentless forechecker. A big-bodied player who sticks his nose in and can carry a significant amount of the on-ice load. Strong on his skates and good with his stick in traffic. Creates scoring chances with his quickness by forcing turnovers, and heavy pressure. Well rounded and smart on every part of the pond. Scored 30 goals as 16 year old in 2011-12, and will probably score at least that many this season.  He possesses a quick release and very hard shot. Stats do not tell the full story on him, and his character and upside are such that he will be a total team player who might just surprise you when he starts lighting the lamp.
