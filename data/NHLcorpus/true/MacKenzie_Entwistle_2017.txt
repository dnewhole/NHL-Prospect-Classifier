A fundamentally sound player with excellent skating ability and great size. He is never going to put up large scoring numbers, but is a guy who makes your team better and helps you win. A North-South skater with powerful stride and very good acceleration. He gets many shots on net when he gets possession. Strong in both ends and may get better in all areas as he develops.
