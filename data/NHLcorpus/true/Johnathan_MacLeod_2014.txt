Big strong shutdown defender with good feet and skill. Has some developing offensive game. Plays tough, with polish and calm. Makes the first pass, and is really good and handling the puck and moving up ice too.  looks like a longer wait, but might continue to improve  due to his skating, improving strength and offensive skills. Fourth ranked of the USA quartet of solid defenders, he still is a work in progress in his own end. It would be no surprise if a team willing to wait jumps up and takes him in the second or third.
