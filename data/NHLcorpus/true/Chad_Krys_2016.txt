A puck carrying defenseman who is a tad undersized and whose game strength is great offensive instincts and superior skating. Explosive bursts in his carries and loves to activate. Displays a precise outlet pass in transition. Is still a work in progress and a defender. Needs long term development to learn to play the defensive part of defenseman. Gets lost and even the quick feet don't help, when he can't seem to be in a position to defend. He is committed to Boston University where he can hone his game.
