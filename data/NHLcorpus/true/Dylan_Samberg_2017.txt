Minnesota native winner of the Reed Larson award for the stateâ€™s best HS senior defenseman in the state. He uses his pro size to play a robust full 200ft game, including finishing on bone-rattling hits. Very strong and mobile, he is well-rounded in all phases and a nice toolbox of skills with room to add more muscle to his frame. He finished the season as a member of the Waterloo USHL team where he will return next year before fulfilling his commitment to the University of Minnesota at Duluth.
