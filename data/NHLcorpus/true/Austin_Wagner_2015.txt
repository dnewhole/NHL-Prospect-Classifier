Power winger who is starting to come into his own on the Pats. He sees little or no powerplay minutes because ehe is oh so very valuable at even strength and one of the better penalty killers in the league. Has a large frame that can easily hold twenty more pounds. His skating strength took an enormous jump and he has gained speed to power to the net, or loose pucks. Quietly becoming a force as he uses his body to finish his checks and makes playing against him quite a task.
