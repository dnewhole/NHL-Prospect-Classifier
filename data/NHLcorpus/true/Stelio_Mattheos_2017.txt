An offensive star in the lower tiers, he is trying to turn himself into more of a power forward. Displays a great shot but his goals come around the goal where he pounces on rebounds. He is a good player in traffic, and can battle past contact with the puck on his stick. A decent wall player who extends possessions with physicality. Can put the power move on defenders using his shoulder to get wide and around defenders. The hope teams will have is that he rebuilds his scoring prowess from the lower tiers and is able to round out to an all-around threat in the attack zone.
