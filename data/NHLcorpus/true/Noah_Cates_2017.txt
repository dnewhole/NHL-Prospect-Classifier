Raw, high school forward whose grown substantially in the last year on and off the ice. Hockey smarts and a strong competitor, this Minnesota high schooler has made considerable impact in his games this season. Is thin but a very agile skater who needs to improve his jump. There's lots to like as he is nowhere close to a completed canvass. Committed to Boston College.
