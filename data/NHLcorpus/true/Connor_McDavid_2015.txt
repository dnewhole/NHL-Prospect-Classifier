One of the most talked about prospects in awhile, he was granted exceptional player status by Hockey Canada, and became just the third player to be granted the draft exemption behind New York Islanders forward John Tavares and current Barrie Colts defenceman Aaron Ekblad.  In April 2012, he was named the GTHL’s player of the year after scoring 33 goals and 39 assists for 72 points in only 33 games with the Marlies. Incredible on-ice vision, and can control play at top speed. Possesses all-direction skating ability and great acceleration that compliments his high-end skill-set. His vision, IQ, skating and hands make his a threat with every touch. Plays at such an exceptionally high tempo that he is a threat whenever he is on the ice. He was selected to the roster for the World Junior Under-18 Tournament in April, 2013. and was also a member of his homeland’s team roster for the World Junior Under-20 at Christmas 2014.
