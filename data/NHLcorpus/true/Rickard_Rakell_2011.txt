Opportunistic jam player with great stick skills. Hard to play against as a three zone hitter, who riles the opposition by playing his game. Unfinished project at this point, but showing all the qualities to turn into an NHL'er, since he makes his own opportunities with turnovers and an improving offensive game. Moved from wing to center this last year and is a Swedish import who thrives on being an effective three zone player who will knock you down to get the puck.
