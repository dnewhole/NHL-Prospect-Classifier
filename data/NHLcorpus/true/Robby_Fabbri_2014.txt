A highly advanced offensive player who understands the attack zone and has a great feel and passion in occupying it. Is a strong skater who stays on track due to his skating base and plays not only strong on the puck but on the forecheck to unearth it.  Tremendous short area burst. Creates chances with good anticipation, soft hands and absolute fearlessness against larger players. If he gets bigger and stronger, some team may draft a huge competitor who already has a two way game and strong back check. Fearless.
