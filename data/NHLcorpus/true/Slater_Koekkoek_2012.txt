A taller player who has a nice size/strength ratio, and ability to jump into the rush. He is capable of adding intense snarl if appropriate, but tends to stick to the business. He is surprisingly quick for a bigger man with mobility and a very fluid stride. Displays good vision on the offensive power play.  He plays a safe game within his present abilities, but can surprise defenders with his speed from the point. He is certainly a prospect with plenty of room for growth and improvement. He already shows a hard quick shot. Koekkoek is a sleeper due to the fact that he didn't receive an invitation to the RDO camp, despite the fact his performance at the Ivan Hlinka tourney was outstanding. Their step-child treatment of him may result in some team getting a huge value later than our projection.
