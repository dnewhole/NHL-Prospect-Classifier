Injured his shoulder after an excellent shown in the Ivan Glinka in August. A player who had shown fair amounts of sandpaper and grit, and strong play on the puck. Good size and room to add weight on his frame. He already carries defenders and is a mismatch when he parks himself in front. Provides a fine screen for outside shots and doesn't take time off, always trying to make things happen. Plays very physical, and good when he doesn't have the puck.
