Prototypical Swedish forward who plays strong all-around and steps his game up when the play ratchets up. Can play all three forward positions, and his experience as a centre has made him an extremely well schooled defensive player.  Is good on the tip-in, and he will be in the high traffic areas looking for them and rebounds. He has great hands and instincts to go with them. Excellent backhand passer. Have an excellent feel for how things develop in the attack zone. Simply a very good offensive zone passer whose work brings chances. He plays like he is bigger than his stature, beating defenders and getting to the opening space.
