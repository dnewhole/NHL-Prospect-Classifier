A Finnish work in progress that already has size, some girth, and some puck skills. Excellent balanced skater with blow by you acceleration and straight line speed. Difficult to impeded as he has a strong balanced stride that can barrel him through the neutral zone. An above average stickhandler who has a nice shot and can thread the needle passes on the move. He needs to make better attack zone decision with his carries and passes. Longer term project with upside who has to become more aware. Reads the on ice situations and play with more effort away from the puck, and ready when itâ€™s time to dial it up a notch.
