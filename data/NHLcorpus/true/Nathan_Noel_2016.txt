Is trying to reprieve a disappointing 2013-14 season. He short and undersized at 174 pounds. He is a swift playerwho darts in on the rush and off the cycle. Has good scoring touch with his hard wrist shot, and is very agile. Provides nice feed and drop passes. Part of teh reason he was drafted two times before is it took him until this season to shown strong acceleration to go with his quickness, His defensive zone presence was almost almost nonexistent. Wasn't that strong on the puck with his carries or very creative or able to make passes to his teammates that show imagination. He was a nice centre-forward in the Q, but that doesnâ€™t necessarily project him as a  pro until he improved those parts of his game. He has and added to his game taking up the role as an agitator and guy you just don't want to play against.Still far from ready to com pete for a role as a bottom six NHLer, he is working towards that goal.
