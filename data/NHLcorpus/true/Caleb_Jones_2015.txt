Younger brother of Seth Jones is a only six foot and a tad under too pounds at this time, but displays an aggressive game from the same position. has lots of mobilty and jump. Has improved much in decisions and his carries, and in his defensive coverage. Feisty player who is good in most phases of the game but hadnâ€™t excelled enough to pull ahead of the bevy of defenseman that may get selected in the later rounds. His development might have changed that.
