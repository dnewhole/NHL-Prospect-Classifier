Undersized two-way defender who is an excellent skater with high end hockey sense, vision, and competitiveness. Plays physical like he is a much bigger guy, and doesnâ€™t see each puck battle as one that he is at a disadvantage. Is so good with his quickness, decisions, and direction change because of his good edging, quickness, and pivots. Reads his own end well and when there are no safe options, he simply carries it out. He really needs to work on his shot as he is no threat to score with it until he gains strength all around. Committed to the UMass (Amherst).
