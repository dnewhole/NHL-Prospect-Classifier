Bigger bodied defender who projects at this juncture as a defense-first stay at home player. A rock in front of his own net, and takes care of clearing it out. Has a solid stride and good jump when moving around his end and in his play in transition. Knows his limitations offensively and plays to his own strengths: bodying opponents out, pin and seals with gusto, and using his thick huge frame to his advantage. Physical in the corners and the front. Is disciplined enough to play a firm simple game in his own end. If a team is looking for a well-rounded defenseman, he ranks as a long term developmental guy, who you hope gains confidence, grows, and offensive side.
