Played in the 5 Nations Tourney 2014 and was a member of his homeland’s team roster for the World Junior Under-20 at Christmas 2014. Slightly built centre wing who has great hands and commitment to improving his two way game. Displays good speed, hands, and Hockey IQ.  Not the biggest body, but is strong forechecker who win puck battles. A playmaker with creativity and good vision who plays big. With William Nylander’s World Junior Tourney injury, he played in his spot. Works hard in his own end, using his body and stick in lanes to take away opportunities by getting back quickly. He sees and reads the ice well and brings his teammate support by drawing attackers his way making space for them. His anticipation,nose for the net, and good hockey sense make his a player who can slide up and down the forward lines, and that will fall in his favor when draft time calls. His size may be a factor in where he is taken. Must continue to make his linemates better plays and continue improving his 200 foot game.
