Raw, skinny, big framed Czech wing with good vision, hand-eye co-ordination, and soft fast hands. Has a long reach and plays strong on the puck. Is quick with reacting and processing. Displays plenty of dangle with his stick-handling ability and agility. Reaches loose pucks, is quick to send the puck on to a teammate. Has good vision and some creativity as a generator along with a quick release in small areas. Needs to fill in the frame and continue his upward developmental climb.
