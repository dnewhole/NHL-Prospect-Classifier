Top scorer on his team  on a point a game pace. even though he is more of a playmaker, he scores some really pretty goals. Very strong on the puck and an all-around high skilled player whose hands, head, and feet make things happen. Very agile and slippery. Has an extra gear and slick stick. Can cut and slash through tight space and draws penalties because of it. A selfless give and go player, he excels as a power play guy with an exciting future. Lias was added as their centre in the Four Nations U-20 tourney in November, playing alongside Carl Grundstr√∂m (Toronto draft pick) and was a dominant player in the tourney.
