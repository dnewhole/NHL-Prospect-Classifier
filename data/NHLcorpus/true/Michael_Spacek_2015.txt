Already displays strong all round game in the Czech elite league but lacks prototypical size. Displays excellent vision, hands and puck control. Can receive hard passes and also sharp soft saucer passes. Forechecks and supports in the defensive zone. A top offensive prospect with scoring touch and passing skills. His head always up and those great hands make it appear the puck is following him around all three zones. He is maybe 5 foot ten at this point and that may be the only negative teams will find in his game. A member of his homelandâ€™s team roster for the World Junior Under-20 at Christmas 2014.
