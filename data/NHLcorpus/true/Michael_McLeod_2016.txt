A centre who wants the puck on his stick. He drives the net with reckless abandon. Strong hands, great feet and body position lets him turn the corner wide on defenders. Relentless and determined in puck pursuit. Has great edging and keeps the pins going in all phases of the play. A terrific passer who puts it on his linemates sticks while in stride. Sees the ice well and has game breaking ability. Soft hands and a strong wrist shot and release, and its will improve as he gets more muscle. A big playmaking centre who can take a game over with his dominant speed.Will need to fill out, but looks like a top prospect.
