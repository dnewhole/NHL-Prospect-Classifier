Dark horse prospect who displays excellent skills with the puck and his stick. His superb skating and compete level combine to make him a player who will get his name called early in June. Great transition player, defensively-able, and can even kill penalties. A late season concussion is what pushed him out of the mid-first round. With a full recovery though, some team gets a big-time offensive present.
