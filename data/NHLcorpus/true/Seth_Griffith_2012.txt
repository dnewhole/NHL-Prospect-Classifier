Skinny offensiveÂ play-making forward who is working on getting bigger and more confident. Both play-maker and sniper, but also is an excellent penalty killer. He has the head to be a really nice scorer when NHL strong. His skating is a work in progress but there is no denying the fact that he leads his club (one of the better junior teams) in many areas and plays with some grit. He easily rotates from the side board to the point on the power play, and is an excellent passer and set-up man. 2nd year eligible leads his team in scoring and it is very difficult to dismiss his chances to be successful at the higher levels.
