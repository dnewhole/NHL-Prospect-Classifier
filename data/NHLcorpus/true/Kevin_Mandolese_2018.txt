Big goaler who fills the crease with a good glove and decent athleticism. Reads attacks well and shows strong understanding and implementation  of the technical aspects of his position. Doesn’t waste motion and is a battler in the “home plate area.” Needs to develop rebound control further and fine tune his shot challenge. Has shown moxie and mental toughness on a poor defensive club. Long term development guy with some tools and positive attitude.
