Youngest player on the Russian's World Junior team, and arguably their best. Big, long-limbed athletic goalie who is at his best when there is lots of bodies near him. Covers much of the net and challenges the shooters well.  He bends over quite a lot and doesn't handle the puck terribly well, but shows good lateral quickness in post movement.
