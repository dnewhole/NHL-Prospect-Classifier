Very large intimidating defender who projects as a 6 or 7 who takes advantage of his chances to play by arriving in a bad mood ready to punish the opposition with ever chance. Not just a bruiser. He will make it hard for you to play against him, but shows some patience and awareness when he is in possession for his team or in the neutral zone. Painfully clears the front. Closes out his man on the entrance, so the rusher remembers it. I am not sure if he is completely adjusted to his growing body, as he will look pretty smooth on his pins on the carry until HE gets jostled. He is not looking to be the offensive force in his pairing, but passes pretty well and has a good shot from the perimeter. There is room for him to get bigger and stronger, and with that his balance and feet may catch up.
