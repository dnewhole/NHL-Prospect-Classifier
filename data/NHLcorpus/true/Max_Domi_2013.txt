Potential impact player whose bloodlines and current course of play exhibit a gritty bulldozer with great vision, speed, and skill. His lower center of gravity, excellent playmaking agility, and all-around game smarts, project him as a scorer and all-around leader in all phases of the game. Shoots a heavy puck, passes tape to tape, and is a load for a smaller package. May not be a big orelite skater, but he still is very fast and robust when necessary. I understand how guys without height are under lots of scrutiny, but Domi by no means has a disadvantage at his height as he is thick, smart and strong.
