Look good in the Five Nations Tourney as a big speedy power forward with an all-around game and plenty of hustle. Strong on the puck, and displays good vision in the attack zone. Has a solid defensive game, is very good forechecker, and plays on the PK.  Very aggressive and stirs the pot on the attack. At thsi point doesn't show accurate decision making when carrying, and he doesn't really show good haves yet.
