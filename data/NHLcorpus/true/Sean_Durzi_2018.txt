A third year eliglble defenseman prospect who had a great start. Suffered a high ankle sprain that kept him out 25 games, but still managed 15 goals and 49 points in 40 season games. Has an excellent playoff until the loaded Sault Ste Marie juggernaut beat them 4-3 in the second round. A top penalty killer and power play guy. Has developed into a top end puck mover who has confidence in his decisions. Makes his team's transition game click. Not too shabby understanding his own end either.
