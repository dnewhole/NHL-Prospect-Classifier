Big solid centre-forward who can score. Has come back from injuries and was a top player in the World Junior U-17s. Displays a two-way game, great skills, and uses his body to make space. Best player in the OHL. Smart, strong on the puck and on the cycle. Makes terrific feeds to his teammates and dominates when pucks are in contention. Can come off the edge with truly strong power moves to the front. He has shown true goal scoring abilities and projects as, at the very least, a top six scorer if the trends continue to improve.
