Power wing on the US club, he started showing the ability to carry the puck, and make moves while in flight. Has the ability to make power moves down low, and work the cycle in deep. Can dominate physically if he wants, and displays a hard dangerous shot. Can throw big hits. He needs to keep his pins moving because thatâ€™s when he is the most effective. Teams will want to see his positives on more than a few occasions in games, and his goal will be to become that player. Committed to the University of Minnesota.
