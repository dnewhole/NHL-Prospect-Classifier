Big bodied wing good on the cycle and down low. Good forechecker who can also create chances. Never takes shifts off and is playing with much more consistency. He is best when he has a bit of space, like when he is busting in in full flight and quickly releases his wrist shot.  He is starting to get comfortable in traffic , but must upgrade his quickness, strength and awareness as he develops.
