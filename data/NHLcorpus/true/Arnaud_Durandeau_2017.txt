Under six footer who has great wheels, edging, acceleration, and hockey awareness in his shifts as a Q rookie. Finds open ice and wins puck battles in the battle zones and greasy areas. Not the biggest guy or frame. Display a good shot that he should use more.  Not that big but has a clear willingness to fight for pucks all over the sheet.
