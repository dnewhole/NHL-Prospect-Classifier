Solid centre-wing with top end speed, a superb stride, and lateral agility. Why his name isn't being noted is puzzling as he is an aggressive knock'em-down-to-get-back-the-puck speedster who projects as an attacking left winger. His elite burst gets him in top gear very quickly and changes direction rapidly. Aggressively gets in for the forecheck, and will use his body to separate pucks from the opposition in the offensive zone. Creative in the attack zone, he makes nice feeds and is best when he has open ice to work in. Projects as a centre, but probably ends staying on the wing because he is not a high end stickhandler set up guy. Hands are quicker shooting than handling but can lose pucks in tight. Is able to cover lots of ice each shift, and does. He has an excellent shot. Needs to get better in his decision making, reads, and become a more consistent player. The fact he shuttled from Liiga, Junior A SM-liiga and Mestis and was asked to also shuttle between wing and centre didnâ€™t help his progress. His lack of production this past year will see his draft value drop, but there is still much to like about this prospect.
