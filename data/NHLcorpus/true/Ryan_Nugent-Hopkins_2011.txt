After tiny Rocco Grimaldi, he is the best skilled guy in the draft. Some guys just have it. One of the good hands people, he shows a gifted ability to work with his skate and stick in traffic, and with excellent acceleration. He seems instinctive and opportunistic offensively. A soft passer and natural scorer, has an accurate shot and doesn't hesitate due to great coordination and desire.  Suberb smart Hockey IQ kid who passes the puck like a musical conductor. He might be prone to sometimes retreating and playing a perimeter game, but that certainly seems to disappear when the hips are down. Obviously far too small and needs bulk and strength, but showed continued willingness in the CHL prospects game, showing he is far from timid and willing at his present level. He simply has the best offensive upside down the road.
