Fearless six foot centre with very good mobility, agility, and gears. Plays strong on the puck and has impressive vision, hands, stick-handling skills and passing ability while in flight. Can play in tight and quickly jump into the open areas and get off strong shots. Good hockey IQ in all three zones, and quick to come back in transition. Takes care of his own end and is fearless in puck battles at both ends. He is unafraid in the battle zones and wall to make plays and work for pucks. Has a quick stick, and accurate passing skills. A strong competitor who will give a good showing each night.
