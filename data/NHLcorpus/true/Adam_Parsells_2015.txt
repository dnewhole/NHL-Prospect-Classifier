Mammoth US born defender with a good hockey IQ an active stick and a wingspan of an airplane. He has great balance and four direction mobility for a growing teenager and is calm and confident going into his zone to retrieve dump ins. Poised in his zone and masks his intentions on break-out well. He has a heavy point blast. Has some carrying skills but is a better player if paired with a true mailman dee-man. His improvement will hinge upon a few what-ifs, primarily if he can become a more assertive defenseman with more edge, and it seems a certainty that a team will call his name and find out down the road.	He will start his development at the University of Wisconsin.
