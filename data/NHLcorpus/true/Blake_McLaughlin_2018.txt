Quick and elusive puckhandler and scoring centre-forward. Very good hockey sense, excellent hands, and finish. He is among the top scorers in the USHL. At this point he is very one dimensional.  He does see some PK time but needs to build strength and an over-all 200 foot game. Needs time to add lower body strength to aid his skating. Committed to the University of Minnesota.
