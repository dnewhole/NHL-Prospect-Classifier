Smart stocky centre with good hockey IQ, playmaking and finishing ability. Strong and balanced on his skates, but not the quickest jump from the get-go. Is great in close and the battle areas, because when carrying, he is quite elusive. Plays a robust physical style. Scored twice in the Canada-Slovak game in the World Juniors at Christmas.
