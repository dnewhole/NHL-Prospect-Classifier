Has been man-sized since he was 16, and was converted to a dee-man due to his size and  temperament. Has a big hard shot, and is good at getting the puck to his mates. He will need more lateral ability to close better,but he does a fine job of clearing the front and protecting teammates. Was named to the USA Developmental team playing in the Ivan Hlinka Tournament. Was named to the U.S. World Junior A roster for the Junior A Challenge.
