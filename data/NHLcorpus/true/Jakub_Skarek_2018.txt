Big tall goaler able to make athletic saves and absorb shots to his pads. Very flexible and active around the crease. Has the come "up-eens" to get behind the net to break up around-the-horn rim-arounds. Really good down low and has rebound control. Still developing and seems to lose focus after letting in a stinker or two. That will affect his entire team's emotion. At times, was the best goalie in the 2016 Ivan Hlinka Tournament and at others - was suspect. Still lots to like when you project the longer path goalies to hone their games.
