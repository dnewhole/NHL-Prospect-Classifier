Four-direction skater with all-around abilities to excel as a pro. Powerfully strong prospect wth great size, wheels, balance, and burst. Plays tough and is a player that gets noticed by the opposition because he goes after them. Uses his balance and natural talent to get in strong hits all over the ice and still maintains position and keeps focused on the game. Plays nasty, and can beat you on O or D. The "Russian factor" had him pushed back in the rankings, but his arrival in North America will most certainly gain him strong first round consideration. You don't get a strong two-way defenseman from the outset, but you do get a big physical one who will engage attackers with regularity. There certainly is time for growth of an offensive game, as long as he chooses to stick around North America and develop one.
