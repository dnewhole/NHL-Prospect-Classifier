A big winger with very good straight line speed, balance, quick feet, and scoring ability. While his numbers in the KHL were nothing to take notice of, the fact that he was on the first team power play says much for how he is thought of. He still needs to make use of his linemates, understand how to use his speed as a device to set up the five man attack, and needs to keep adding strength. Plays aggressive, hard, and with grit, projecting as a power forward. A creative three zone player who was able to impose his will and be on equal footing with grown men in the KHL. He will only get stronger and more dynamic.  There certainly is enough there for teams to consider him as a highly skilled prospect that wouldn't be available late in the first...
