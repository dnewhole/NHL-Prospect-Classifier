Superb short stocky centre who is a top skater that can make plays at top speed. Dynamic top end skater with great jump and dangle at breakneck speed. A great skater whose balance makes tough to knock him off the puck. Any loose puck has a chance of being his because he works hard to unearth them and make chances for his team. A battler who doesnâ€™t seem to view himself as the smaller guy and it can hurt him. He is so surprisingly quick and has a very deceptive shot. His puck skills let him set up his linemates, and he makes sure he is in position in the defensive end. Works hard, and leads by example. He is more of a long term prospect because he needs lots more core strength and then he will become a bigger threat.
