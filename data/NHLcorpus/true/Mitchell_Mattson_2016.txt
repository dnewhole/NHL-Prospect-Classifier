Big and really can skate well., and advances the puck well. Displays a strong stride, nice passing skills, and is committed to playing a 200 foot game. Needs to build his underdeveloped frame. Looks like he might project as the big centre teams look for.  So far he hasn't  blossomed into a scorer, but there is time  to develop in college as he has committed to the University of North Dakota.
