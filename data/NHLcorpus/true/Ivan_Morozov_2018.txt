Offensively skilled centre who stood out at the World Junior Challenge as an unselfish pass-first centremen who works very hard to play a 200 foot ice.  A larger framed guy with a long smooth  powerful stride. A pair of soft hands and playmaking ability. Not a finished product but you have to project that there is lots to like. The scoring and offensive generating will only get better as he builds a more mature offensive game.
