Quiet and effective big centre/wing who takes care of 200 feet efficiently. Strong and smart competitor who can put the puck on a teammates stick or let it go. Thrives in the middle zone with his sound defensive coverage and is very good in his own end too. May be will suited for a switch to wing as a pro. Spent much of the season on the wing with Nylander and Centre McLeod.When he makes contact he usually leaves an impression. A developing prospect whose feet will improve as he develops and who checks boxes when you examine all the things he does well.
