A man among boys who displays the raw tools to develop into a NHL power forward. Tough forechecker and good feet for a big man, he has toughness, an active stick, and a good release. Goes to the front without hesitation and is good on the cycle. His size causes problems for the opposition. He displays good hands and when he adds some leg strength he may be even more difficult to contend with.
