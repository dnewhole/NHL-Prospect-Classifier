Undersized compact prospect from an athletic family. Never stops impressing upon his observers that he plays 200 feet the entire night without letting up. Displays a really nice first step and terrific edge control. That allows him to patiently slip into seams, stop start on a dime, skate to passes, and surprise in the scoring areas. Not the fastest skater, but has a good pace every shift. Really good shooter on the move, and very good at handling the puck in small spaces. High energy motor, diagnoses, and with his compact stride - catches teams whether he shoots or makes pass that they donâ€™t expect. His recognition of where his linemates will be and his slippery demeanor make every pound difficult to contend with.
