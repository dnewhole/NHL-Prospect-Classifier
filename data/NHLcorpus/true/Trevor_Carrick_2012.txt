Wide-framed skinny kid who is working at adding thickness. A defense-first defender with good feet, and good backward skating ability. He is very good down low in his zone, where he uses both his quick stick and physicality to thwart off attackers. Smart mobile defender who can thread the needle on the outlet pass and close down on attackers. Projects as a player with good upside due to the fact that his decision-making will improve as he reads the ice better. His offensive game will come along.
