Interesting sleeper who is averaged sized, but has significant upside based on his all-around skill and puck handling ability. Really strong on the puck and a deft passer on the move. Has a variety of fakes and can convince defenders he is taking the shot while he is making time for one of his teammates to actually get the puck to make the play. Has good instincts and good handling the biscuit on the PP. Has shown improving compete level at both ends and must continue to be a better player when he doesn’t possess it. Was on his homeland’s team roster for the World Junior Under-20 at Christmas 2014.
