Solid two way centre with good vision, quick stick, and good jump once he get the legs churning. Wins 50-50 pucks, sets up screens in front, and has some bang to his game. Thinks the game well, and is willing to do the work to make a play. Has improved his work in the defensive zone. As he progresses, it is hoped he plays with intensity every shift.
