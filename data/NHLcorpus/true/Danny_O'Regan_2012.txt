Solid under six footer who is good in all phases. He had a solid performance in the tournament 2011 U.S. Under-18 Select Team in Slovakia. Committed to Boston University, as he is the son of former Terrier and NHL forward Tom O'Regan. Two-way center with grit, gears, and excellent transitional instincts. Plays on the PK and is a threat to move the puck for a scoring play every shift.
