Stood out in international competitions with his high skill level. Creative player who is fearless in all parts of the offensive zone. A smooth skater who is deceptively quick with his soft hands which allow him to get loose and/or set up linemates. Fearless in traffic and is great in one-on-one.  A strong forechecker. The way he beats you is by coming out of a pack with the puck and using his lightning release to wrist it into the net before defensive players can react. As with all the Russian-based prospects, their final draft slottings are entirely tied to whether or not they are committed to crossing the pond and actually attempting to become NHLers. He was selected to the roster for the World Junior Under-18 Tournament in April.
