Lean, very agile winger with excellent edging, speed, and acceleration. Might develop into a real scoring threat because he is attacks with East-West mobility and fearless net front presence. Still maturing both physically and as an all around player. He uses his get-up to capitalize on pinching defenseman and in shorthanded situations. Still a work in progress who needs better recognition and muscle to help out in his defensive zone. Looks like there is potential here which will help see his name called fairly early.
