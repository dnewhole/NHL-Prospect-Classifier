Skinny, undersized skating defenseman who has a non-stop motor and is patient with the puck on the attack -- and an err of fearlessness. Smart and patient on the attack, he waits for the defenders to commit and then chooses his best option. A non-stop lightweight who will need time to gain strength and girth.
