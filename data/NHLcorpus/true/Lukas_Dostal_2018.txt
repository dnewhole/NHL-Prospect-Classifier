A well-balanced, well-controlled goalie with a cool and calm demeanor. Has a good glove hand, moves with balance side-to-side and up-and-down. Stares down shooters so they make the first move. Is under control and angles shots off into the corners. Reduces rebounds in the middle area. Never riled and focuses when barraged with traffic in the home plate area. Finds loose pucks before opponents do. All-in-all a good long term developmental player who needs to get a bit taller and add plenty of muscle and girth.
