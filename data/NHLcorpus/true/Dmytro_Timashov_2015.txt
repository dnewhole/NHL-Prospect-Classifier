Fireplug winger who arguably is the most dangerous player in the entire Q. A 190 lb six foot nine Ukranian/Swedish wing who is fearless in traffic and a gifted offensive playmaker who may have 100 points by seasonâ€™s end. Hungry to win, and imaginative with the puck. A tremendous stickhandler and agile skater who can make any defender look bad. He basically is a perimeter player who can center of the puck and control it in most areas at high speed while patiently reading his options. You are not drafting a strong defensive player but the trade off is a guy who makes odd-man rushes and match-up challenging the entire game.
