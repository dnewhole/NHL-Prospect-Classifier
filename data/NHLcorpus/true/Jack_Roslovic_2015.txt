One of the best players on the USA-NTDP team, he is of average height and weight at this juncture, but will grow bigger and stronger. A relentless never take a shift off winger who has excellent instincts and IQ for the game. Very good in the heavy traffic areas and on the the wall. Creates turnovers on the forecheck and when he has the puck in the attack zone, he keeps the pistons churning strong on the puck in tight space. He has excellent anticipation and get himself open in the prime scoring areas, and is good on the give and go. A shifty guy with really goods hands and puck handling ability. Saucers the puck really well and can receive and dish at high speed. Unselfish, passionate player whose future is looking upward. Committed to the University of Miami of Ohio.
