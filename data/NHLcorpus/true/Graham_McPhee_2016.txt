Hard working winger with a bit of edge. He works hard in the battle areas and has in the past displayed some offensive upside, but still has been limited to a supporting roles, and was on the USA Under 18 team as a 4th line checker. He finishes his checks and makes space and comes in hard on the forecheck. He is good in puck pursuit, and is good on the PK. He is committed to Boston College, where he maybe able to develop the offensive of his game.
