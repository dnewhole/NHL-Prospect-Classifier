Wispy framed centre who plays on a team loaded with good players up front. This has him playing a lot less than so many of the other prospects. Not big, not strong, just super quick. Sees the on-ice situations and uses his extra gears to push back defenders, and set up his wingers. On the 2nd PP, and has shown he is a nice set-up man. He has a willingness to use his head and feet in building a 200 foot game. Not big not strong but has lots of tools to build on. He may never be able to carry a ton of extra weight on his frame, but as he continues his developmental training, he can improve his shot, and anchor.
