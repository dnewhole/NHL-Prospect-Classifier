A forward who does most things well, but none spectacularly. Unselfish complementary player with a smart and unselfish game. Does all the little things that teams need to win. Drops back when one of his defenseman activates, works the wall and greasy areas. Will continue to develop his game in college, as he has committed to Ohio State University
