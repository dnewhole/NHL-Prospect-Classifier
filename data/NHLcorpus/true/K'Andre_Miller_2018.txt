Converted forward who is a large physical defense-first defender who is nearly 200 pounds. Very good in motion as a puck carrier, can shoot the puck as a point man or when he activates as part of the attack. Uses his size to and length against attackers and lets the opposition know he is there near the blue paint. Responsible in his end, makes sound decisions, a good outlet pass, but gets in trouble with his stop/starts, or when caught not moving. Passes well in all phases and reads his end well, using his teammates on the way out. Will let his big shot go while pressing in the attack zone and opens up with a hard fast one-timer.  Still learning the nuances of the backline and is quite smart at trying to do things as simple as possible at this point. As he improves his feet, he might gain more assertiveness going up ice through the middle zone with zone enrties. At this point projects as a bottom four defender.
