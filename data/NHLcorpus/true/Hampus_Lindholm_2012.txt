Smart, steady skater with a solid two-way game, but basically is a defender that quietly and effectively plays strong in his end. Very mobile and agile for a big man. Good in his own and especially down low. Showns his muscles along the wall and in clearing the crease. Rarely attempts much more than the safe play. Will get bigger and stronger. Already uses his size. Long term development still needed, but many things to like about him. He was excellent in the Under 18 World Junior Tourney in May.
