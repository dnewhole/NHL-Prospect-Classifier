Small Q defender who consistently shows he can be a top junior defender despite his lack of girth and height. An instinctive offense generator who four direction skating and light edging make him a player. An excellent PP QB with a heavy shot good hands and lateral agility. Instinctive in both ends. Gets open on the track and as an outlet for his defensive partner. His feet help him to close on defenders in his end. He is difficult to line up and hit because he keeps moving and is low, and posing off them. The question becomes how small can an NHL defender be? The Wildâ€™s Jared Sprugeon lasted until the 6th round, only to have the team that drafted him, the Islanders, decide two years later to not sign him. He has solidified spot on the Minnesota backline. Clearly a terrific developmental player albeit one of a smaller variety. He led ALL Canadian Major junior defenseman in scoring this season and a point for game in the post season.
