Great size/skill ratio, and great feet. Leads the rush into the attack zone and shows great confidence on offense. Still an unbridled pony in his own zone and needs to play under control. His lateral mobility, good feel, and hard shot make him a good power-play QB. His point shot rockets on net with little wind-up, and he displays a confident presence when he has the puck. He is a deft passer, carrier, and offensive generator. He has a quick stick, and sees the developing play like an elite pro, and is quick diagnosing and reading in all zones. He will need to add girth, strength and a bit more snarl, but he has the looks of an excellent prospect.
