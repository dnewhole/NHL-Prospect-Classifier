A big winger who has great skating ability and gets to top speed fairly quickly. You donâ€™t expect to see a prospect this big with the speed to breakaway from the junior defenders, but he does. After they play against him a few rushes, they see how he  forces them to back off. Displays a good strong shot, very good hands and an emerging physicality. He can beat you one on one, with a shot from the perimeter, or with body work. Projects as a player who can develop into a power player.
