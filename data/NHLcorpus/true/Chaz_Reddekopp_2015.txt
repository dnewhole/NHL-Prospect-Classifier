Intriguing prospect on the backline with excellent size and physicality. Clear the crease and handles the wall. Loves to throw his weight around and engage attackers. What has to develop is his offensive side. Would rather dish than take shots, and always passes if there is a hint of pressure from the defense. Ends up rushing his shot when he does try and take it. Long term prospect that a team might want to select and bring along  his offensive side slowly.
