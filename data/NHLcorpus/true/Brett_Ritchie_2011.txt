Good balanced straight-ahead wing who passes the puck well and is good carrying it. Had a bit of an injured season, but has shown soft hands for a bigger guy, and exceptional wall work. If he was able to get quicker, he would be an even bigger force to contend with when he goes to the net/slot area.
