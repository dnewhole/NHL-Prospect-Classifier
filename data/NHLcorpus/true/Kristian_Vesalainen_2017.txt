Excellent combination of skill, size, and shot.  Reads and reacts to situations in the attack zone well and is strong on the puck. His quickness allows him to separate the opposition from the puck. Strong quick release. Can play either side and displays power and speed. He closes on defenders with his top burst of speed and they are unprepared for him, which leads to penalties or he will blow straight by them. He makes things look easy, like he is a veteran player, reading the ice so well, making terrific give and go passes, with power and agility in his handling of the biscuit. Terrific finisher with a heavy shot. Looks like a top ten selection at this juncture. Already being touted as "Jesse Puljuj√§rvi lite," there are a lot of similarities, but Vesalainen still has a ways to go.
