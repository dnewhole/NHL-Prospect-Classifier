Quebec native who is making noise as a 17-year old in the USHL. Strong offensive game, and solid defensively. Good on-ice vision and high-end carrying ability. Very quick footed and has more than one gear. Plays the power-play point with maturity, and with added strength his shot will gain mustard. The knock against him is that he can become a liability defensively when the games get feisty. Just isn't tough and determined in close games and seems to cave when pressure is applied. He is still sound in many instances and has time to further build a tougher game defensively. He committed to Boston College.
