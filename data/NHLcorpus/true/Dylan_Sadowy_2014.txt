Feisty winger who isn’t the prettiest skater but is has quickness in his long strides that gets him involved on both ends of the ice. Is smart with the puck and has a quick shot that netted him 27 goals. Is a battler in play and will drop ’em. A gamer who will block shots,  and compete hard out there for 60 minutes. can fill out and get stronger in the lower body to get even quicker, but is showing there may be enough to make the NHL grade in the lower lines.
