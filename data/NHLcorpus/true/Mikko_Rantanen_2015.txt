Displays a strong game on the wall and dominance below the circles. Has excellent vision, playmaking skills, and above average feet an effort in all three zones. He is very strong on the puck and uses his size to control play, bring havoc in the front and when he gets the puck it’s tough to get it from him, whether it is in the cycle or when he moves out off the wall. Seems very in control in his carries. He has solid jump and speed and the vision to find openings. If there was a knock it would be his low scoring totals so far. One could argue he wasn’t playing with pivot able to get him the biscuit. Others might say he lacks the high end soft and quick hands, foot speed and agility when passes are sent his way. He has spent time on IR, but is a very intriguing prospect. He was selected to the roster for the World Junior Under-18 Tournament in April and also was a member of his homeland’s team roster for the World Junior Under-20 at Christmas 2014.
