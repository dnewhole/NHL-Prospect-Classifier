Large bodied left winger who skates well and has good functional strength who finishes his checks and puts pressure on the opposition. Can generate chances. Will play hurt.Although more on straight line skater he has a strong burst with top end acceleration that allows him to get away from his checks. Strong player in the corners and battle areas. Separates opponents from the biscuit. Better when he keeps it simple, and looks for loose pucks continue to finish his checks (as he does) and makes quick decisions in his offensive zone possessions. Potential power wing.
