Big left winger with size, speed, a great shot, and  on-ice intelligence. One of his team's leaders. There are thoughts that his game is hampered by his team lacking a top centre to play off of. He still manages to use his quick wrist shot to score on his own, and he is able to create chances for teammates through his stellar work in the attack zone. He Is a powerful skater with good drive, balance, and acceleration. I have heard the constant criticism of his foot speed, but he gets there and is smart enough to do all the work on scoring plays without it being a huge deterent; he lacks a true first step, but no one can convince me his feet hold hIm back in the NHL, and as he improves them, you don't wait for all the rest of the parts of his game to develop...he has lots there already.  He has a terrific release and drives into the slot area, protecting the puck before he shoots or passes it. Very good board player and defensively responsible.
