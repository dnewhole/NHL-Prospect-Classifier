Looked like the best defenseman in the USHL top Prospects game with solid tools and hockey sense. He plays an aggressive game in both ends, with good decisions and movement. Is a strong defender down low, and when going up ice, he is a no-hesitation carrier who handles the puck very well and with confidence. Not terrific in any aspect but solid in all areas. Committed to the University of Minnesota at Duluth.
