Player whose hand-eye coordination and stick-work is off the charts. Fearless wall player who at this point looks like more of a set-up man than scorer. Granted, he has a quick release, but he seems more willing to make an unselfishness play as a set-up man. He works the corners and front very well to the benefit of his linemates. Needs work on the defensive side of his game, more strength and girth.
