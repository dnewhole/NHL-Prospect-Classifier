Second year eligible Finnish centre is big slick stick-handler who needs to work to further strengthen his lower body in order to add power and speed to his skating. He has good skills and vision, but little consistency. Needs to be better away from the puck, and continue to grow his offensive side.  Displays some really good dangle in his possession skills but has trouble deciding what the read is and can look bad when things go south in transistion. Committed to Denver University where the team who selects him will expect to see upside.
