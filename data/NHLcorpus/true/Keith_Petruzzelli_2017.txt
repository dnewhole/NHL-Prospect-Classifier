Impressive big goaltender who has finally slowed down and learned to let his enormous size and gifts to do the work instead of getting in “fire drill mode.” Terrific combination of size and athletic ability that has NHL teams returning to make their final ranking decisions on him. Displays a strong glove hand and excellent awareness in his area. So big that when in his full spread, he covers the entire bottom while on his knees and still covers most of the top corners! Committed to Quinnipiac University.
