An effective supplementary defensive player who reads the entire ice and situation very well, but is a short strider with little speed and limited offensive abilities as his hands and stick have not caught up with the high tempo game speed. Is a determined penalty-kill guy, and really good forechecker, who is always willing to go to the wall to take punishment and unearth pucks. He is smart with the puck in transition when the turnover happens, but gets handcuffed when he is involved in a high speed penetration that might require a snap decision and follow through.
