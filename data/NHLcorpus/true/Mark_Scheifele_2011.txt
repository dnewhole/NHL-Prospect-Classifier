Good sized play-making forward who Coach Dale Hawerchuck has taken under his wing. He is working to build muscle mass, and is working to get faster, less heavy-footed and skate with a lower center of gravity. Plays strong on the puck and once going is effortless in his playmaking. Long term project, who may have elevated himself into the first round by virtue of a superb performance at the Under-18 Worlds.
