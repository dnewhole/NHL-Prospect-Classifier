Big man with good balance who is strong on his pins and difficult to move off the puck. Has a decent shot to go with very good stick skills.  Goes hard to the front of the net. Fearless and always willing to take punishment and not back off from returning some. He might be a better player if he didn't have such a pass-first mentality. Suffered a shoulder injury that will shut him down the rest of the season.
