Made his North American debut in the World Junior A Challenge. Surprised with his balance, footwork, lateral agility, strong pivots, lightning release and heavy shot. Uses his body in all three zones and will step into the opposition. Leans to hold off fore-checkers while he is moving on the attack. Creative carrier and passer who anticipates offensive flow. Supports the attack in his five man unit that expects him to get low if the opportunity opens. Did I mention his fancy foot work and ability to change directions? He stops and starts and almost always make crisp outlet passes from his end.
