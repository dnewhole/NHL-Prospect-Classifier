An offense-generating centreman who creates looks by using his terrific speed to barrel through and deftly set up teammates. Has excellent vision and a nice tempo in his carries where he will dial up his pace and surprise  defenders. This playmaker will create separation for himself and change direction keep control, cut back sharply, and still be in possession. Uses his acceleration gears to lull defenders before he dashes away from them. More of a pass first attacker who might hold the biscuit a bit too much, but there is lots of upside to him. Hockey USA might have won the Five Nations tournament, but he tilted the ice and elevated himself an early selection maybe as high as fifth overall. Needs strength and girth, but showed no fear as he cut through to the dirty areas to create chances.
