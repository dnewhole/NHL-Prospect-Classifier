Has the size, tools and skill to be considered an early pick. Was strictly a forward until midget hockey, so there is a bit more polishing needed, but is a superb stickhandler, passer, shooter, skater and physical player. Quick snapper, booming slapper and quick passer who clears the front of his crease too. Viewed as an all-offense defenseman, due to his skating, puck-carrying and heavy shot, he will grow into a well-rounded defender based on his abilities, vision and hockey smarts. Given time, he may be a true impact player.
