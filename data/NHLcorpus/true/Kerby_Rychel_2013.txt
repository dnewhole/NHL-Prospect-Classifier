Warren Rychel's son is as tough as nails, a ready and willing combatant, and a grit player. He has good hands for a guy whose bread & butter is down low, where his tenacious forecheck can disrupt and cause havoc in the cycle. His skating needs work, but he moves with agility and strength, and poses problems on every shift with his physicality, playmaking abilities, and puck control. Plays in every situation and even takes the odd face-off. He scored 41 goals in 2011-12, and no matter how you break down his lack of elite skills, or his average size, he is a player that just scores with hard work.
