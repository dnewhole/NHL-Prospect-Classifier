A third year eligible dee-man who is an aggressive puck carrier, and attacker. Plays under contra; at a high rate of game speed. Possesses great wheels and gears and explodes past players when he has the puck. Loves to lead the play up ice, and is a strong passer. Has a nice point shot.  Gets his stick in the passing lanes on dee, and isnâ€™t afraid of making contact. At this time, he is very light, and not strong enough. But has elevated himself as one of the better attacking defenseman in the USHL. He is committed to University of Mass. (Amherst).
