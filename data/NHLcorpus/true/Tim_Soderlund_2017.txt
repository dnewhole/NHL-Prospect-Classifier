In someways, he is a Viktor Arvidsson type- Not all that tall,or as thick yet, but has an excellent straight line burst, and one of the faster guys in the class, and also a gritty forechecker who fearless unearths pucks and moves around the battle areas making good passes. He hasn't shown high-end passing skills but has goos hands and head in his carries, and makes plays. Needs plenty of time to get bigger & stronger.
