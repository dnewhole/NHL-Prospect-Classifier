A solid defensive defenseman who's offensive side is starting to blossom. Strong skater with a wide base and good pivots that allows him to take an aggressive line of defense. He closes the gap to contact. Very instinctive, smart in his reads and understanding of his position. Has an active stick always disrupting the passing lanes. Positions himself so he always seems to have leverage on the competition to take them off the biscuit. Transitions out of his end well, and also passes the puck out well. He can carry out in transition and enter the attack zone due to his wide skating base. A work in progress, but lots of good things there including one of the better skating strides backwards. Committed to Denver University.
