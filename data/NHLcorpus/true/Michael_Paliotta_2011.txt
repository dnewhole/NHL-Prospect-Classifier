Physical long-armed rearguard who is a really strong skater for his size. Great lateral ability besides North & South. If he could develop an edge it would be to his advantage as he seems to be balanced enough to stay in control when he does play aggressively. He does close but many times avoids the thump he could lay on attackers. Plays a safe game in his zone as he hasn't become an effective up-ice guy, but may when he becomes more effective in handling the puck.
