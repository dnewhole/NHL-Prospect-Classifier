Plays on a deep Seattle blue line with a steady, non-flashy game with good positioning. Takes the body and takes care of his end first and foremost. Displays an active stick in the lateral passing lanes and, in most phases, is rarely out of position. Makes the first pass out in transition for his team, and can stick with his check, using the body to separate them from the puck. Very calm and collected, he clears the front of his net. Only an average skater at this point, he needs to improve in that aspect. Adding more edge would increase his success to move up the ranks to the higher pro levels.
