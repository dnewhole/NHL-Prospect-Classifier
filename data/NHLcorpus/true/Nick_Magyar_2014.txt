In a draft where many post first round scoring forwards are smaller, this kid has the offensive ability and frame to grow into a good player.  Plays a smart responsible game that is less fancy. Not a fancy lateral guy who dekes here and there-but uses his good hands, anticipation, vision, and a strong forecheck to attack. Has a physical side. Finishes checks, uses his size on the wall, and then gets open. More weight room and development might add muscle that will help improve his leg drive and foot speed. And as so many youngsters he needs work on the defensive side, but plenty of upside there.
