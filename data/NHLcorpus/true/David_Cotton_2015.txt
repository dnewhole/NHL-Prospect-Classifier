Big centre-forward with a long reach and excellent skills and head for the game on the entire sheet. Good in the dot and uses his vision to make crisp passes. Has a higher upside than most in terms of O, but before in my top five rounds I would like to see a sample in a higher competition level. He committed to Boston College where we will see just that next season. Some NHL club may not wait.
