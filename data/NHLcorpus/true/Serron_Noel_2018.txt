Giant raw wing who isn’t close to the final sum of his parts. Has been on an upward spiral all season and this 200 plus pound, six foot five right winger is still working on foot speed, but has really good agility. Displays a good stick, and is starting to realize how he can dominate with his hands and big body to handle tight space. The comparison with past Q big forward Julien Gauthier stops right here; this giant wing has quick hands and some lateral ability, that separates him significantly. His long reach coupled with his long legged fluidity let’s him cover lots of ice in a shift. Goes to the net and has physical tools that might lead him to a strong NHL career. He’s never gonna be fast, but is strong on his pins, and uses his size to create time and space with an edgy game. Continues to improve his play away from the puck, and has room to add muscle all over, which will help him improve his movement.
