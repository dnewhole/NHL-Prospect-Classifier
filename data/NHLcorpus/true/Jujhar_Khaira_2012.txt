South Asian heritage C/LW who is a bigger mobile forward with a good all-around game and excellent shot. Positionally sound, reads the play, and has a quick release on an improving shot. He is still one more year away from college and will make a nice long term development player, who needs to improve his foot speed to go along with his tempered aggression. He loves the heavy-going and so may the NHL team that drafts him.
