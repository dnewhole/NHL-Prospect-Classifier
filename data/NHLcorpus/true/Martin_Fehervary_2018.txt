Slovak defender who has played the last four years in Sweden. A very good skater with lateral agility and a good stride. Good gap control and processing in the defensive end. Can make the home run pass from his end, and has a willingness to carry the puck out of trouble. Basically sticks to the system. A player with small point totals but the upside to elevate his offensive production as he continues to develop. Had only ten total points during the season and playoff; a workhorse earning tons of ice time. He likes the puck on his stick and has an aggressive side. Still far from a finished product who looks to challenge for a pro job in the not too distant future.
