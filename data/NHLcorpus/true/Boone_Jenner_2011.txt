Big center who plays fearlessly with good balance and puck position. A team leader who may get even bigger, and already plays all three zones. Skating is a work in progress, as is his passing. He likes to carry and shoot, as well as be physical. His defensive game needs work along with his foot speed. He does everything above average, but so far is not special in any specific area. He plays a gritty game though and comes ready to play. The question may come down to if he can continue to elevate his offensive side.
