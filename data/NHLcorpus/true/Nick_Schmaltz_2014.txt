Longer term project who is not the sum of his parts. Displays good feet, vision, hands of the high end level, but his work ethic is on the low end. Needs to become an all around team first player, one who helps his team get chances, and not wait for the team around him to provide him with scoring chances. Takes many a shift off, and can disappear in a tight checking game. The question remains will the team that drafts him see the dazzling skill and motor for 60 minutes? Was named to the U.S. World Junior A roster for the Junior A Challenge. Committed to North Dakota University.
