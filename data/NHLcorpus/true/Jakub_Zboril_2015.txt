Emerging defenseman with good size/skill ratio. Displays excellent vision as a first year player in the "Q" who has superb four direction skating ability. Very elusive when carrying, and really good at closing the gaps when defending. Has shown he can ride attackers to the wall and check them hard when away from it. Poised and quick to make that accurate pass in transition. Is smart and patient on the PP where he makes use of his hard low shot, or move the biscuit to the option. Still learning and far form the polished player on the backline. He still has mishandles and lapses in judgement due to bad positioning and sloppiness I will defer to his newness to the higher competition.  Needs a stronger commitment and full game commitment, but there's much to like.
