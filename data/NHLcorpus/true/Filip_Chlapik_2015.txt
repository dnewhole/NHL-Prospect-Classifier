Plays song on his skates and has good speed and first step quickness to go around defenders on the rush and then to the net. It is difficult to separate him from the puck. Works hard in his defensive zone and come back for make his defensemanâ€™s outlet pass easier. A good back-checker. He still needs to get better offensively and also develop more lateral agility.
