Big wing who moves well and plays strong down low and on the wall. Very good speed and quickness for a big man and great upside for this once high-scoring midget player. Uses his body and is above average speed in battles for the puck. Kills penalties. Is willing to take the hit to make the play. Displays a very good release with his shot.  He was selected to the roster for the World Junior Under-18 Tournament in April.
