Highly competitive little man with excellent acceleration and a really heavy shot. Can go wide on defenseman and battles for the puck and drives the net.  Backchecks, and attacks with the same quickness. His 120 points (including 74 assists) in 71 games tied him for the regular season scoring crown alongside linemate Brendan Leipsic, and 28 points in 21 games through the WHL playoffs. Teams will think hard if he is on the board, because he may be a Jordan Eberle clone. Explodes in transition, and soft hands and great skill. He will work to gain strength and get his weight to 175.
