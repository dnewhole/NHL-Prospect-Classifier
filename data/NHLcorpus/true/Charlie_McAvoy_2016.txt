Young Boston U. defender whose past USNTDP Juniors resume might typecast his as push the pace offenseman. But he shows smarts, good decisions and consistent defensive game as well. A thick six footer (still growing) with a muscular frame that handles the older college opponents well. Displays quick feet and excellent decision-making and assertiveness on his touches. Processes and acts . Smart without the puck. Ties attackers on the wall, and displays good positioning. In transition he makes the quick first pass and and stays with the play sometimes joining into the rush. Can handle the PP QB role. Has a strong hard shot. Distributes the puck well and has heavy shot. Still needs improvement in footwork; gets into trouble when he is unable to pivot and move backward on opponentâ€™s when they are making a push into his defensive zone. Injuries to the BU veteran defensive core called for him to get an early baptism with significant playing time in key situations. Still a work in progress, and needs to improve his puck decisions and tone down his riverboat gambler style of playing the back end. Despite the warts his potential has the 18 year old is rising up the draft lists.
