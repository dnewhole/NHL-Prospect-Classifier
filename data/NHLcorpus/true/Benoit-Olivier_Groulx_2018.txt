The first pick in the 2016 QMJHL draft is a big solid wing whose not afraid to get gritty. Tall and fundamentally solid in all areas. Strong skater with a nice stride. Plays with strength but truly lacks a quick first step. Understands team play and plays well no matter what line he is on -- and can get the job done. Scores mostly from inside the dots and in front. He likes to bull his way there and take the shot. Isnâ€™t a high end attacker or speedster at this juncture. Plays mostly in a defensive role. Longer term developmental guy who teams you hope builds a stronger offensive game to go along with his defensive presence.
