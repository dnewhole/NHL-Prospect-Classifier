Big, tall Quebec league winger who uses his body with reckless abandon to unearth pucks and apply strong (physical in some cases) backside pressure. Possibly the youngest project in the draft class. He needs more girth, strength, and skating development to be able to improve the power in his stride. Improving his feet will make the difference to whether he is really a prospect or not. There are no complaints on his commitment on the sheet, where he works so hard for sixty minutes. Takes many a hit to make the play, and hits most moving opposition players in sight. His shot is also a work in progress.
