Huge developmental winger from Long Island who needs more leg strength so he can get to the spots to use his size. Needs  to develop his hockey instincts along with his skills and feet. For a huge specimen, doesn't make enough use of it. Doesn't read the attack well, or at this juncture, have the jump to stay in the play at both ends. Scored from deflections in front, and on the PP, where there was space. He will need to actually develop over the course of more than a few college seasons to show possibilities as a NHL- level contributor.
