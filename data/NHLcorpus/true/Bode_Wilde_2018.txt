He is over 6 foot 2 and the first thing you notice is how fast he transports himself and the puck around the sheet.  He is a good passer but you can’t help but notice he wants to hold on to the puck, come into the attack zone, and be the difference maker. He stands out on the power play or whenever his team is in attack mode. Gets a lot of power behind his heavy shot. Easily slips down to soft areas, receive pucks, and take shots between the dots -- and he loves to do it. Uses his skating ability as an asset when being a defender. Harnesses his balance and smooth stride to get there to seal attackers off to the wall, closes gaps quickly, and close soft spots by filling them. Willing to use his size to step up and into opponents, and will clear the front. He won’t seem anything but calm in his own end, even when you may think he need to be. The wild colt aspect about so many of this draft classes defenseman has been noted so much already, but this is yet another player who seems less inclined to play conservatively by holding back in transition. He wants to make the clean entry by his lonesome and is good at it! He wants to get the transitioned pucks and go back down so he can see the defending goalie's eyes -- then score. It is this all-in, I'm-gonna-win-it-for-us play. Many times it comes back and hurts his team, but there is so much to like about his abilities. Projects as a possible top 2 pairing NHLer whom you cannot deny on the carries. Takes chances to be the difference maker. There is high upside if he continues to grow his all around game. I know I would select him. Big physical blue line presence with keen two-way game and skill set. Displays big time physicality that sets the tone. A terrific skater with a booming shot. Decide to de-commit so that he might play in the OHL and maybe be a bit more desirable to NHL suitors....
