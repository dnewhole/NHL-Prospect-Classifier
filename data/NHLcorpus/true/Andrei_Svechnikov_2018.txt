Spent significant time out of Barrie's line up with  a wrist injury, but ranks as the top forward on my list. That's due not only to his scoring ability, but also his ability to generate looks on the attack in many ways. Despite his injury, he's still second among all CHL rookie prospects in terms of points per game. Possesses good size, a lightning quick release, and a resume that includes a 30 goal season as a 15 year old in Russia, a 29 goal, 58 point in 48 games in the USHL as a 17 yr old, and 36 points in 21 games with Barrie this season.
