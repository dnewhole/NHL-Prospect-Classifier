Six foot defender with excellent puck skills and mobility. Loves to jump up in the play offensively. Good breakout passer who evades the forecheck and makes the accurate pass in transition. Good one on one take on skills as a defender, and plays well man to man defensively. Handles attackers on the wall and plays big enough to win the puck battles in his own end.
