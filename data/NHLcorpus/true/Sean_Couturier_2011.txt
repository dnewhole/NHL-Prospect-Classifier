May have become Angelo Esposito-like in his fall from grace of once being thought of as the top pick. Big, strong game-breaking scorer-generator, who has a terrific Hockey IQ and feel for the game situations, seemingly projecting him as a can't-miss NHL center. A terrific stick handler, tape to tape passer and playmaker with a long reach and quick stick. Can hold the puck an extra bit to free space for teammates, and while the puck is on a teammates stick, he seems to know where to position himself to cause the most damage. With great stick skills comes an improving heavy accurate shot. Very responsible and active in his own zone. Not the fastest guy, his skating might be his only area that will require improvement. It might be that when he puts all the pieces together, he becomes a strong NHL player with the goal of becoming a first line centre. Some say his upside is limited to second line center since he hasn't seemed to grow further this season, but no NHL team sees him as a consolation prize.
