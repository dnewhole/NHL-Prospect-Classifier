Opportunistic Danish import who displays quick hands and is always around the puck. His father Todd, played pro hockey in North America. Helps create chances with smart movement and strong, persistent forechecking. Top rookie scorer in the WHL. Knows how to attack, with very good stickhandling ability and soft hands. Not big, not fast, just makes plays. Unafraid to get dirty and throw hits. A member of his homelandâ€™s team roster for the World Junior Under-20 at Christmas 2014.
