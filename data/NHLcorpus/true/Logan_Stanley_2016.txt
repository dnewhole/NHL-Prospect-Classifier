 Giant defensemen with a great reach, and decent mobility for a youngster this size.Has an active stick and his length lets him close gaps, and Is exceedingly calm under pressure and despite the need to get stronger and bigger, he doesn't wilt in his defensive zone. Clearly needs quicker stop/starts and better acceleration, but most assuredly an NHL team or two will consider selecting him and letting him develop further.
