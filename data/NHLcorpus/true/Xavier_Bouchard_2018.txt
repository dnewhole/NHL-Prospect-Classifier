Long-term developmental defender that may be able to hit paydirt and make it worth the wait. Has size strength and skating ability, and is very good at anchoring. Keeps opponents boxed out. He simply is off far too much on his passes and the it is almost like there is a bomb on the end of his stick that explodes into a turnover. Patience and excellent developmental coaching is what will be needed.
