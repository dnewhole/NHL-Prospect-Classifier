A big athletic defenseman with good skating ability but needs to work on pivots and turns. Better when he is in open space or not in close quarters. Ends up having trouble when pressured and turns many pucks over. Uses his size as deterrent along the boards, and his stick to clog lanes.  He displays an emerging offensive game in the attack zone, but needs to improve his puck skills and in-game IQ. Long term developmental player.
