Playing behind bigger names in the USNTDP d-core,  Emberson plays a simple yet effective game. His positioning 1-on-1 allows him to be very capable shutting down offense, while also allowing him the opportunity to deliver thunderous open ice hits. He does not shy away from physical play or from engaging attackers.
