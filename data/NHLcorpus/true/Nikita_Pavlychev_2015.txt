Hulking centreman who stands eye to eye with Ben Bishop. He is only a little over 200 pounds so there is plenty of room on his frame to fill out. Has decent feet and puck handling skills and is surprising agile for such a large guy. is really good in his own end. Even with the developmental wait, it seems very likely a NHL team will call his name, and see if he can add the necessary balance quickness and strength to his game. Committed to Penn State.
