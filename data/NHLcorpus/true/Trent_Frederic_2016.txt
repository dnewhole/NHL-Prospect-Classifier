 Centre with good size who plays strong on the puck and good puckhandling skills.  More of a North-South straight line skater with little lateral mobility. Displays a very good shot, with nice release. He might project as a future left wing, but he really needs to add to his offensive game and add more creativeness to his attacking skills. Drafted by OHL's Niagara. He has committed to the University of Wisconsin and he may hone his offensive side there.
