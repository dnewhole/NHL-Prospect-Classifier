Third year eligible is an undersized skilled attacker who uses his quick feet and motor to attack the net with reckless abandon. A scorer who lives to take the shot. Good one on one. Good quick release. He works hard in the defensive aspects. His game is far from rounded and at this point is dependent upon linemates feeding him.
