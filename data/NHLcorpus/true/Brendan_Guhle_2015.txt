Longer term prospect who is very thin and undersized at this juncture. Terrific four-direction skater with great acceleration and stop/start qualities. Smart decision maker on defense and up ice. Effortless jump in his boots and has great edging. It will take time while he grows his game and gets bigger and stronger, but there looks to be a reward in his selection.
