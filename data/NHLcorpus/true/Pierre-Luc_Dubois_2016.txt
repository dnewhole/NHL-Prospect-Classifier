Came into the season after have success as a intense wing who had good size, hockey sense, and composure. He was strong on the cycle, a terrific competitor, and a frame that could easily fit more muscle and girth. He had all the makings of a first round pick at wing. The move to centre has given him more freedom to be creative in the attack zone and he still plays a reliable defensive game. Can be equally effective at setting up plays and scoring. Had the Tampa Lightningâ€™s strength coach Mark Lambert teach his a pro strength regime. Part of the reasoning behind it he is not a blazing skater and needs a bit more explosiveness in his leg strength. He also is getting a leg up on adding muscle to his entire body. He does have a long stride stride that he can improve on. Competes well in all three zones. Has great vision and a real nice set of hands and is dedicated at improvement in every phase. There will be no transition when the club that drafts him calls him up;he already understands what is necessary , has a professional air about him in that he already is detail oriented and serious about succeeding as a player. He is a high character individual whose star is beginning to shine brighter as the year goes on. One of the safest picks on the board.
