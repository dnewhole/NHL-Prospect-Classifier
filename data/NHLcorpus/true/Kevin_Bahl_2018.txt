Huge raw defenseman with underrated puck handling and distribution skill, he plays a physical game and gets his long stick into lanes useing his reach to defend. Make a good first pass out of his end. Doesnâ€™t readily transition to full free attacker, but has a willingness to carry the biscuit and is a good stickhandler and passer too. Supports the rush well and will get down deep too. Still a work in development, and will need to improve his shot release and accuracy. Scored two goals in the CHL Prospects game. His size and upside clearly points to him getting his name called to begin the work toward the big league.
