One of the riskiest decisions in the draft is surrounded around him due to the fact he is only six foot although he is a first rounder prospect in terms of his on ice play. Has great flexibility and spring to his down-to-up movement. Handles the puck with the best of them. Has soft pads to soak up shots and reduce rebounds, and stays square to shooters making them have to be perfect in their attempts. Tracks the puck really well, and quickly goes cross-crease with excellent push form post to post. A competitor with strong focus who gobbles up rebounds, and if he can’t stay with the puck, he can stop the second attempt. You have to wonder in the era of where teams think having a  giant “statue” goaltender who is a big plug will be a deterrent form goals being scored, when will a guy this talented get picked, or even iF he does.
