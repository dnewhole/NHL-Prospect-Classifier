Plays both ends of the ice very well. Has a good frame and will continue to grown into it and get bigger, and surely he will become less shy playing like a larger guy. Already better then most “Q” defenders at using his mobility, reach, stick, and to have his stick on the right side of the puck carrier. Deceptively fast and always willing to lug the biscuit up ice. Because he is bigger and his stride is so fluid, he catches you off guard with how fast he can accelerate and then surprises again when he executes at top speed. Jumps up from the blue line deep in to the attack zone and has the speed to get himself back up ice. Has a slapper he keeps low and a strong accurate wrist shot. You would like a bit more physicality and see him push attackers off the puck. While he shows he can separate players from the puck decently although, they won’t be looking to see if he is coming next shift. Has already shown enough to be considered a top half of the first round candidate, but I have concerns he might not have the elite quickness and "head" speed to become a top NHL impact defenseman.
