A edgy team first player who finished 4th in the World Junior Tourney scoring. A good balanced skater who is tough to knock off the puck and crashes and drives to the paint. The opposition doesnâ€™t like him, and he manages to rile the opponents with his nastiness. Has a strong sense of the play and reads the ice well during his penalty killing duties. Has a nice touch with the puck and good stick skills shows good touch with precise passes in traffic. Very opportunistic, and has good enough feet to get separation on defenders. May be seen as a 3rd line player with good skills,vision and edge who drives hard North-South and plays a physical.
