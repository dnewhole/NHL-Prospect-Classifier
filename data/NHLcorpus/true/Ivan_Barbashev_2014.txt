Hard working centre-wing with quickness, good anticipation, and smarts. Plays on both the PP & PK. Plays with fire in his step, and breaks the strereotype that we tag Russian prospects with. Relishes tough games and difficult match-ups. As good at setting up as shooting, but he is a scorer, with a really quick accurate shot. He can dominate physically at the present level. He was selected to the roster for the World Junior Under-18 Tournament in April.
