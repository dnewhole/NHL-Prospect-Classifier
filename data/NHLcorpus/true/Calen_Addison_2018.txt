Study, tough, undersized defenseman with good feet, balanced skating, a long glide and light edges. Really good polished offensive game that includes good positioning, fast reactions, and good use of his stick to impede pass receptions. Wins the race to open ice pucks. Never hesitates to stand up attackers. Makes the long stretch pass and uses the side boards to chip pucks by the opposition. Is a deceptive tape to tape passer in the attack zone. Will pinch in and then pivot and make space before driving the puck further into on the attack. There is a fearless confidence to him, that smacks of future NHLer, but undersized for his position.
