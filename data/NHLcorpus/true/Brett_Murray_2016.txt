Sleeper with terrific size, good strength, and surprising skating agility. Handles the puck very well, and is not shy about using his size to get his way. His Canadians team won the CCHL championship.Has some offensive upside and scouts will give him close looks as the draft gets closer. He will grow his game at Penn State next season.
