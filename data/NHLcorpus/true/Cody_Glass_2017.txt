Late bloomer with excellent speed, quick hands, and sneaky release. Since last season he gained 20+ pounds and grew more than a couple inches, making him tough to push of the puck in his possessions. Has a high hockey sense - finds the open seams, gets open, and anticipates where the puck will be. Strong on the puck, keeping it away from from opposing defenders. Displays excellent all-around speed. He looks to get even bigger and stronger, and has significant upside.
