Second year eligible late birthday who is a disciplined attacking wing with nice size and fluidity to his feet. Thick build and naturally strong and powerful, but lacks first step quickness and projects as a grinder/power winger at this juncture. Loves to initiate contact and is best down low in the attack zone. Is a battler on the wall and in front and causes problems for defenders. Projects as a North-South power winger who has a skill game to match his physicality. Has committed to the University of New Hampshire.
