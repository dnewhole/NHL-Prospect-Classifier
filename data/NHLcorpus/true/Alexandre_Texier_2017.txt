French born centreman who was France’s best player in the Division One World Juniors despite being the team’s youngest member. Displayed excellent poise, vision, and hockey sense to go with his heavy accurate shot, crisp passes, and a high tempo motor. Has a bow-legged stride, but is well-balanced and is light in his edging and a threat to score with each shift. Played on France’s top line and ran the power play from the half wall. Looks like Philippe Bozon may have a successor.
