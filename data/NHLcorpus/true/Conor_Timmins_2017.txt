Promising defense prospect who seems cool and collected in most on-ice situations. Sees, thinks, and reacts at a high level with his passes and attack strategies. A smooth skater and puck-handler who is very smart with where he directs it. Has a great touch and leads his teammates to where his pass is going. Can make the hard-up-ice blueline break-in from the neutral zone, or with sweet saucer passes from both sides of his stick.
