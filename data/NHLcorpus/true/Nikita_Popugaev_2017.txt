The team that selects this huge Russian prospect will be doing so based on size and agility at his stature, and his over-all skill level. Able to quickly start and stop, and be a frightening presence. For a man of his size, his stick-handling is off the charts. He plays the puck close to his feet and pops up very quickly, getting maximum torque with shots and passes. His long stride gets him going quick so he can coast, looking like a jumbo jet about to take off. Plays strong on the stick and presents problems all over the attack zone as he turns quickly and then will cut back through the layers. Was traded and is leading his Prince George Cougar team with more than a point per game. All the signs point upward, although scoring a few more goals may seal the deal in the scout's minds.
