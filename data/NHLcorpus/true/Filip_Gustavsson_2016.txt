This right shooting goaler may possibly the best net minder prospect out of Sweden, he followed a shaky Swedish league start with an excellent World Junior as an integral component in most of the wins. Positionally strong, he keep movement to a minimum letting things come to him. Good going side to side, squares up on shooters, and is an athletic battler in the opposition gets to the net. Can over-commit, and still needs to build his game. As is the case with many Euro goalies, he plays a bit to deep in the net.
