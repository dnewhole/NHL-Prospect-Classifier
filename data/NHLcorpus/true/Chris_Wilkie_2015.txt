High energy wing with great wheels, strong hands, a hard shot and quick release. Reads the offensive zone well and positions himself well in support. Strong defensive zone recognition and aggressiveness. He may be a bit undersized, but displays creativity, commitment and strong defensive end awareness. Great clutch competitor who plays smart both on the attack and in pursuit of turnovers. Has a good hard shot and strong handling ability. Relentless on defense, where he out-manueuvers puck carriers and uses his stick to take the biscuit away. Long term project who needs to read on ice situations better, and play accordingly.
