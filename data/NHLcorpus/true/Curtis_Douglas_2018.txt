Six eight and still growing, this left winger has massive frame and uses it for body lean and not as a destructive hitter. Long reach gets him to loose pucks and he protects the puck very well. Has good hands in close. A work in progress who is just learning the nuances of playing in his own end and coverage. Long term developmental prospect.
