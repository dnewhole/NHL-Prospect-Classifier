Under six footer with good speed, hands, and high-end passing ability. At the Ivan Hlinka tourney, he was the second best scorer. Great on-ice vision and skill set. Is simply a player that is opportunistic,always in the right spot and able to use his quick release to finish. Is one of thiose players that has that feel and advance sight, so he can distribute the puck to the right teammate or get to the open spot to receive it. The question is how well he fares against bigger stronger opposition. He was selected to the roster for the World Junior Under-18 Tournament in April.
