A strong, balanced, quick-footed skilled defensive prospect who led the Canadian contingent at the Ivan Hlinka Tourney in August. Shows all-around abilities and good instincts to eventually anchor an NHL pairing due to a cool calmness when QB-ing the play. Skates with a nice stride, and can pivot or turn away from pursuers, while passing the puck to an open attacker. His game includes creativity while jumping in, good decisions defensively, and a growing offensive toolbox that allows him to play at a quick pace. He rarely turns pucks over, and always positions himself to close down the attackers. In this strong class of defenders, he clearly exhibits the best power-play quarterbacking skills, whether it is with a pin-point pass or a carry through and passed the crowd. Dynamic offensive puck carrier who makes going up ice look easy.
