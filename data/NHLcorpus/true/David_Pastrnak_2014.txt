Smaller wing/centre who has great feet and hands and tons of dangle and nose for the net. Really good when he has the puck and handles it whether he has open space or under pressure. One-on-one he is a joy to watch, as he seems to have a holster full of moves that thwart defenders. Drives the lanes aggressively and is good in traffic. Displays a quick release and rocket shot that catches goalies by surprise. Not a burner North-South or great defensively yet, but he moves quickly laterally and turns and jukes and provides plenty of excitement for those in the seats. He was selected to the roster for the World Junior Under-18 Tournament in April, 2013.
