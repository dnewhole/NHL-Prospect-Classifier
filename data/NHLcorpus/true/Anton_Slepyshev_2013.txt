Undrafted last year primarily due to the "Russian factor." He is an agile wing who shows exceptional offensive abilities and leads his team by his play. Already a strong two-way player. played on wing of Russia's top World Junior line. Not a player who woes you with extraordinary ability in one phase. He is simply good at all phases, and both PP and PK are strengths. Smart when carrying puck and will only get better as he fills out and gains strength. He has two years left on his deal in Russia so the team selecting him will wait two seasons before even getting him over the pond to adapt his play to the North American game.
