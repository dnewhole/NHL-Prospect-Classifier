Colorado-born winger who has a strong skating base and leg drive. His acceleration and power lead to his reception of lead passes in full stride and good finish using his strong wrist shot. Controls the pucks at high speed and can breakthrough opponentâ€™s checks and has displays good passing plays. An aggressive checker looking to take possession of the puck. Still not the polished player, who needs time to improve his vision/reactions and keep possession when he has it. Committed to the University of Denver.
