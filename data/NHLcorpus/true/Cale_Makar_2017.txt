This small defender has all the making of a future NHL offenseman. Seems to be in constant motion, and able to intercept pucks and turn them in to quick strikes towards his opponent's net. Very undersized and will need plenty more muscle as he continues his development. Cleary one of the smarter and better offensively talented Dmen in the class. The PP QB on his Alberta Junior League team, and has a quick release of a point shot that he gets off without taking a big backswing. He displays strong wrists take enable him to get strength on his shots and zip on his passes. After being selected to play in the World junior Challenge, it what might have been viewed as a step up in competition compared to the players he faces in the AJHL -- but he looked dominant in many phases, using his lateral agility and athletic strides to cut through the neutral zone, activating to open space on the give and go, and reading ensuing plays and covering huge areas of the ice with his feet. His speed and good edging work in consort with his ability to handle the puck at top speed. When he is doesn't have the puck, he looks to jump on errant passes or ones sent cross ice changing possessions. Will pinch but always gets back in position in a few strides because he's so quick. Holds a strong gap. This is a player who creates space and time and plays smart. More of a long term development project -- but he is a player.
