Former Centre converted full time to defense. Committed to the U Conn. but that will not be until 2015. Might be five years from the team selecting him having to make the decision. Displays excellent quickness and skating ability. Quick to the puck carrier. When carrying, he reads the ice and  has several gears. Usually one of the fastes players in any game against any opponent. Long term project with lots fo questions but also lots to like.
