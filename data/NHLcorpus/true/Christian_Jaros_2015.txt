Aggressive hard working and physical stay at home defender who can be calm and composed in his because he understands the play in his end and works really hard to make sure goals are scored while he is out there. It is an unpleasant experience to meet him in front or along the wall. He won’t use his stick to take the puck away - he will take you off the puck. He has great size and good balance for a big man, but is a short strider who does pivot well but does get caught on close one on ones. He has good lateral agility and I would be selling him short to say he isn’t able to skate it out of trouble or surprising mobility when you see him throw an open ice check. Not the most aware or creative guy on the attack, but you can count on his had point shot, and intensity with ever shift. A member of his homeland’s team roster for the World Junior Under-20 at Christmas 2014.
