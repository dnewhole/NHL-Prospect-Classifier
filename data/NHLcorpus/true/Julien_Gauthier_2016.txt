Big winger with a strong fluid with a terrific shot and release. He uses his body to take pucks away, and win possession battles in the offensive zone. A big man with soft hands, a great one-timer and a willingness to go in the dirty areas and in the front. He can change gears and surprise defenders by beating them off the wing. Q defenders get caught in denial thinking no way can a guy this big be that explosive. Needs to develop more as a play-maker, and get pucks to his linemates as well as they feed him. He is a a North-South skater who depends upon his linemates to get him the puck. His game needs rounding out, but looks like an excellent prospect.
