High School defenseman with powerful legs all direction skating ability and a good burst. His skating balance meshes well his puck handling skills and gives him tools enabling him to either make that first pass or carry the puck out in transition. Doesnâ€™t get rattled and plays with a bit of edge, and jam. Still developing as an offensive player and teams will project him as a long term project who has committed to the University of Minnesota.
