Strong, balanced skater who shows outside speed and an excellent shot. Plays a mix of a power-forward and sniper. Plays with power on the wall and wins puck battles there. The lightning release of his shot and his ability to find space make him much to contend with. Plays fearlessly and hungry, creates space, is a playmaker, and shoots extremely well. Reads, sets, and attacks well with a dominating presence. Throws big checks. Powerful shot. Will improve his abilities to handle the loose pucks by planting in the crease.  He can line up at any of the three forward positions and not look out of place. Has NHLer written all over him.
