Good puck abilities, and scoring prowess. Has some quickness and digs in. Big three-zone winger who has some power game, is very active all over the ice. If his scoring production was better, it would help him on draft day.  Presently teams will view him with limited offensive prowess, and maybe lacking in enough jam to compensate for it. A good balanced skater who will need to work on increasing his speed, but he gets there, plays good defense, and will be worth a selection.
