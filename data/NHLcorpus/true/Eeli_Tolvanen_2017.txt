He is not yet six foot but hard not to notice in every game he plays. A natural offensive generator and scorer who uses his acceleration, quick bursts and a quick stick. Has a NHL shot which he gets off quickly and he needs little space to place deadly accurate spots in the back of the net. Needs to round out his game and get bigger and stronger, but he is a natural scorer with a lightning release and great jump to get to open spaces in the attack zone. Elite shooter with a strong stick which will get pucks away from the opposition. Is determined to improve his defensive game and over-all play. The elite rifle is already in the tool cabinet.
