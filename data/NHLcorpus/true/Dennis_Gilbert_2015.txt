Big two way defender who is best when he sticks to a simple game within his comfort level. Decent skater with an active stick. Tough and very willing to box out along the wall in the attack zone. Has balance and can use his girth as leverage to clear the crease area, but his foot speed and puck skills continually put him at risk in his end.  Plays with an active stick and poke check. He continues to improve and has committed to Niagara University where he will be able to develop so he doesn't have issues with the speed game.
