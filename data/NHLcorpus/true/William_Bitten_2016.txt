Lightweight speedster who is strong in his carries. His low center of gravity makes him hard to tag. Can score. Has soft, quick mitts and good IQ in the attack zone. Works hard and long on the forecheck, his size not an impediment. His set of gears and good anticipation yield many opportunities and the fact that he plays fearless in the dirty areas only makes opponents respect him more. Is committed and good with the biscuit in his own end. Doesnâ€™t possess a big frame and is going to need weight room development to up the odds of his chances to make it. But you have to see his grit, desire and persistence as qualities that he can climb the rungs.
