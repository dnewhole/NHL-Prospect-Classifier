Big hard working three zone centre-forward a strong stride, size and very good puck skills. Positionally solid with excellent vision and playmaking abilities. Good in the face off circle. Shoots the puck quickly besides being a strong set-up man. Stood out a one of the better players on the ice in the World Junior A challenge. If the whispers that he is transferring to a CHL junior team are true he seems destined to being picked early. He is a pretty complete player already and is tough to move off the puck, and is excellent in the one on one battles all over the sheet. He may be fairly close to playing soon.
