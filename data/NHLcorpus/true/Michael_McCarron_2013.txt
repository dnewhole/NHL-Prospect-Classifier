Defensive minded forward with great size, jump, and punch. An intense physical competitor who leaves an impression so you know you have played against him. Very good straight-liner balanced skater who must tighten his pivots so he can turn with play. Good vision. Does an exceptional job of winning pucks but needs to improve his tight quarters work and become stronger on the puck when carrying. Displays very good effort without the puck with his reach, and back-checks hard. This is a big bodied North-South forward with very good skill set, and can play downright nasty and well. He is getting co-ordinated with his growing body, he has to be viewed as long-term pick with significant upside. Nonetheless, he seems to be rocketing up the draft boards. Committed to Michigan. He was selected to the roster for the World Junior Under-18 Tournament in April.
