3rd year eligible wing is a scorer with hard wrist shot and quick release. Strong when carrying on the attack and is able to find the soft areas in the attack zone for the set-up pass. Well balanced skater  with a set of gears. So far he isn't very interested in the defensive zone. Committed to Western Michigan University.
