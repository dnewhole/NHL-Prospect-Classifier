His fluidness and light edging are what starts the conversation projecting him as an eventually pro defender. He has on-ice tools and a two-way game, but he still is learning to put his game together, making the right decisions, and getting to where he is operating more on instinct with his movements -- just not there yet. But there is much to like that projects him as a pro defenseman. Even if he fails to reach his upside, some team may end up with a solid five or six for many a season.
