You don't need to look far to know he is a heavy shooting big bodied forward who has a good work ethic. He has decent hands and a strong hard shot. Creates scoring chances and wins puck battles, and willing to knock the opposition right off the puck. His skating is an area that he needs to improve as he needs a couple steps to get into stride, and needs more mobility. Granted he can close on opponents but needs to get a head of steam up. Is strong on the puck and protects it well. Displays good vision and creativity, but his defensive game is a work in progress. Will bring physicality at center, no matter how well he develops as a center. His selection slotting is completely dependent upon whether he projects as a second line NHL center by NHL scouting staffs, or 3rd or 4th line.
