The transition to the smaller North American ice stunted his early growth, but his high hockey IQ and effective puck movement has elevated his status from earlier in the season. Is a highly accomplished skater for a man his size, and his long stride gets him to the puck rapidly. He has adjusted, calmed, and plays like he is looking to where his next option is without the hesitations from early on. Gets his long stick in the passing lanes and breaks up plays. Heâ€™s a long strider who will improve his feet as he grows into his humongous body. A long term developmental project who need to get stronger and quicken his pace.
