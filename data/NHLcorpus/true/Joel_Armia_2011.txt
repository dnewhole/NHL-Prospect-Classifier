Soft handed, big Finn sniper with a high compete ability, skill level, and improving skating prowess. Receives and handles the puck well, good forechecker, and cornerman. He has good vision, a quick shot, and a quick stick. Not a burner but deceptively fast once he gets going. Fearless in the battle areas and able to play with or without the puck at a high speed. He has displayed good effort on the back-check, and a quick release in the attack zone.
