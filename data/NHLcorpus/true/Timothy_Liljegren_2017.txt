Started the year ranked as a top defenseman prospect based on smooth and mature play from the back end as a puck mover, attacker and PP man, Thick not large, but there is little on the negative side on how well he uses his abilities to defend. A world class skater who has agility mobility and great acceleration, he displays high hockey IQ and reads the ice as well as any NHL defender. Already in the Swedish Elite league and not at all out of place. He really hasn't gotten any bigger or physically stronger, and that might have him sliding down draft lists from top defenseman in the class to maybe a risky selection early on. He is a strong puck mover who will fearlessly lead the attack as a newbie in the SHL. If he does slide, he may make one NHL team's scouting staff look like geniuses.
