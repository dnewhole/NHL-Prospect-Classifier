The jury is still out on this lanky Swedish defender who may be further away from the finished product than most. This is a very mobile big man is in his infancy in terms of reading the play, decision-making, and establishing position of the opposition. And after all that is sorted out, a bit more edge would be nice. Plays well when he simplifies his game. A long term developmental project who could develop with work.
