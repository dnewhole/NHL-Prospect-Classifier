Another offensive defenseman with 200 foot capability. Plays solid in his own end and continues to improve as he gains strength and adjusts to the faster pace. Doesn’t get intimidated or flustered. Is willing to challenge attackers by stepping into them or funneling them outside. Played solid in the Ivan Hlinka in the summer, and continued to improve his game all season with Halifax. Has grown to almost six-one and is very mobile puck carrier at 190 pounds. Has found a nice balance of get-up-and-go and stay-back-and-defend, in this the year of the “offense man.” But still prone to forcing plays and some real issues with his lack of awareness and processing in high-pace close-quartered defensive zone situations. He is going to have to be more self aware of when pressure is about to close on him. Better vision and having his head up on a swivel before getting blind-sided or stripped.
