Smaller than average centre-forward who plays much bigger than his size.  Displays terrific speed to dart in and out of areas and make it out with the biscuit.  Not afraid of the work in the corners, his low center of gravity makes him difficult to knock off the puck. Has very good hands and can thread the needle in holes to reach his linemates rushing into the seams. A tireless forechecker who gets his shot off without needing much room. Continues to build on his defensive game and he stays close to his man all the way back in his zone before he transitions up on the offense. Still very light and in need of more weight room work, but looks like a solid prospect due to his all-around commitment and game.
