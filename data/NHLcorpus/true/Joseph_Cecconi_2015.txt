Big bodied fluid motioned stay at home defenseman who had his own cheering section at the American Prospects Game in his hometown Buffalo. Displays flashes with a big point shot, willingness to muck it up, ability to play with the puck where he had some nice touch on his passes, and make very good decisions with it.  The real is issue at that game and others you only see tidbits of those strengths, and lots of areas where improvement has to come. Uses his size and strength to his advantage makes solid decisions with the puck and showing poise in his own end. May not have a high level as an offensive attacker but still can help a team by playing inside his abilities while handling the puck.Still a good long term developmental prospect. Committed to the University of Michigan.
