Big aggressive winger who plays a passionate high energy aggressive style. Has a strong powerful stride. Is more of a North-South skater who bulls his way through to wherever he is going and crash and bangs. Has a strong shot that packs some wallop, but there is also wallop when he dropsâ€™em. He is know to stick up for teammates and gets them more space because of it. In short space he will accelerate and meet opponents on the wall or in the paint. Has a heavy quick shot that needs to gain more accuracy. He is known to catch opponents with big open ice checks. Displays high character along with toughness, size and feisty 200 foot game. A streaky scorer and the jury is out as to whether he can contribute heavily in that aspect. Plays like an old fashion grinder, who may gain more consistency as a finisher as he develops. But he may end up as a checker who can chip in a goal here or there.
