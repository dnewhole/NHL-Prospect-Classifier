New age defender with good puck movement skills, nice foot speed, good hands and a good stick. Funnels attackers to the side boards, can make the secure outlet pass in transition. Very smart in all three zones. Has a soft touch, and excellent puck skills. Defensively and offensively aware and stays on the right side of the puck. His foot speed lets him control the speed of the game making nice touch passes. He walks the blue line and uses his deceptive snap passes to provide scoring looks. Sneaks downs and makes things happen. Will need to add strength as he develops.
