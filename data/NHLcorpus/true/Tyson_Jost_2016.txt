Shifty centre with impressive feet and stickhandling ability. Can stickhandle in a phonebooth. A team leader who on the ice and in the room. Great vision and recognition in the offensive end, so he spreads away from teammates and then pinpoint passes to their sticks on the give and go. A terrific finisher with a great shot.  Disciplined worker hin his own zone. Wins puck battles and turns them into chances. He knows where to place himself so that the puck can find him. Makes his teammates better. Not the finished product and needs more lower body strength and muscle. He has committed to the University of North Dakota.
