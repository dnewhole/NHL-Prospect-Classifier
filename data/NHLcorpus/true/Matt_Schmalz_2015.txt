Huge centre who has nice hands and exceptional defensive zone presence. Has the quickness to be back on the forecheck with regularity, and is a strong board player at both ends. May never be a highly creative offensive performer but does display good hands. If he was to develop more of an edge as he fills out he could have upside.
