Big centre-wing who can skate, move the puck and score. Soft hands and emerging physical tools, with good vision and execution. Giant centre who simply doesnâ€™t seem to get what he needs to do to move upward and progress as a player. Gifted with the skills and size to be a dominant player, he seems to go through games without any hint of grittiness, or high compete level. Shows little creativity or intensity or involvement. Some team may call his name with the idea they can get him to develop.
