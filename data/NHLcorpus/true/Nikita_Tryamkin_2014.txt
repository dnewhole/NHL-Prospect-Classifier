Chara-size russian giant who was drafted last time around. Plays with an over-supply of nasty.  Knows he is far from the polished mobile backliner so plays inside his limitations.  His skating is rough with balance issues and lack off jump and he is better without too much handling of the puck. Long term project with an upside to be a shutdown defender once the feet and muscle and game figure it out.
