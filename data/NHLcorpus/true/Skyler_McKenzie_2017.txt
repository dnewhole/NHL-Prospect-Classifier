Fearless small man is a second year eligible wing has enjoyed a super productive 80 plus point season with the Winterhawks. He is counted upon to be an all situation player who blocks shots, and sacrifice his body in any situation. You can argue that he benefits from playing on Cody Glassâ€™s wing, but they actually feed off each others play. A key penalty-killer. Displays a quick release that helped him reach a 42 goal season. Some teams may go after this player despite his diminutive size.
