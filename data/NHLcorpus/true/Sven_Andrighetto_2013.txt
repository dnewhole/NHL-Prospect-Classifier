2nd year eligible diminutive wing who is very skilled and will get consideration in the late rounds. Displays offensive tools in a compact size, and made every NHL team take notice with his play in the QMJHL playoffs. He QBs the pp from the point with a wiked one-timer.  Seems strong and durable enough to get consideration as  prospect who can advance into some level of the pro ranks.
