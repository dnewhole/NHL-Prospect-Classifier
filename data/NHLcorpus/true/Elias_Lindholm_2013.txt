Another prototypical Swedish forward with excellent NHL upside. Has good wheels, tremendous quickness, a quick stick, and plays strong on the puck with overall game toughness. Could be a special player down the road. At this point more of a playmaker, but his recent showings have displayed a really smart offensive threat who can withstand the rough going, while maintaining his more finesse style of play. Currently playing wing, but can play pivot too.
