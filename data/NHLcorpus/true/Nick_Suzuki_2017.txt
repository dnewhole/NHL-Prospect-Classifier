One of the most feared penalty-killers in the OHL, he never goes unnoticed every shift. An under six footer who is a puck magnet, and continually gets loose so his teammates have a scoring outlet.  Responsible defensively and has continued to hone his overall game. Small, but able to both score and set-up his linemates.
