Los Angeles born Russian centre who simply can fly.  Oozes with skill, multiple gears, and good instincts for reading the ice. He is both a playmaker and a natural scorer, who seems smart and fearless in traffic. Changes directions and anticipates where to be and has good puck control. Ccan start an offensive look from a simple pass, dangle through the trash, and hide his release while shooting on the fly. Dangerous at even strength and on the power play. He gets in position for rebounds and quickly sets teammates up when his look closes down.
