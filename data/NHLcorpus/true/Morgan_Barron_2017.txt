Big centre-forward with good size, strength and feet. Has a heavy shot. The issue is he doesn’t seem to see the ice well, read what’s happening, or show he has the hands to be more than a one man show. His linemates never see creative passes and looks on his part. This St. Andrews Aurora, Ontario student who has committed to Cornell University.
