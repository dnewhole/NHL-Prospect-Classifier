Big winger who played for the first time in the top SHL. He is a large kid who shows a willingness to bull to the front and and displays in many instances, strong lean while along the boards in the battle areas. A good skater who has jump enough to come out of the corner separated from his check and thus becoming a dangerous target or shooter. When the season started everyone jumped on the bandwagon, extolling his attributes. So maybe the present quiet calm is a smoke screen so he is on the board when the team that likes him is on the mike.
