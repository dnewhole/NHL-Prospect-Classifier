Big thick-framed player with plenty of upside. Plays both ends well, and with good physicality and picks his spots with timed collisions and wall-work. He has decent mobility and balance and plays a positionally sound game. PP distributor who throws hard checks on defense. He needs to get quicker on his feet and in his decision-making but looks like a prospect who may project as a dependable strong two-way defenseman. May be a bit closer to NHL-ready than most other defenders except for Murray.
