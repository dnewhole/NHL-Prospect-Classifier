Tall left side defender who plays a bit bigger than he is. Is solid in his own end and is very good in all phases of the defensive zone. Passes the puck well and has good hands under pressure. He plays with some edge and tries to let the opposition know he is out there. Untapped offensive potential due to his hockey IQ, hands, and stick. Scored 11 goals and 35 points in the open QMJHL, so that leads me to think there is upside as an attacker too. Big solid junior defender who projects as a guy a team takes and develops. Displays good play-making ability and balance. His skating is a work in progress. He is good straight ahead, but you want more agility and better pivots in setting his gaps. As he hones his play at both ends of the ice, you would like to see a bit more physicality.
