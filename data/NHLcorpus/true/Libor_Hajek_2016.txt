Aggressive mobile dee-man with decent skills and can move the puck offensively. Strong and thick-bodied. Plays with good intensity and awareness. Takes the body, pins/seals on the wall and wins puck battles. Has a long stick and is decisive when advancing the puck. His skating is high end; excellent in his stop/starts, and his first steps. Light on his edges and very aware of positioning in his end. A good passer and despite being new to the North American ice surface, has shown much to like in his first year.
