Another in a long line of U.S. grown big defensemen who year after draft year look to have so many interesting characteristics, although on their draft day the players are not finished products. Big framed, good skater and puck carrier. Has good puck skills but still learning the nuances of attacking. Injury put him out of viewing for the Under 17s, but the very fact that his father is a former NHL'er puts him on the radar of all 30 NHL clubs in the last half of the first round. Already displays an active stick and decent gap control due to his strong skating game. Raw long term project with possible big payoff. If he doesn't go last first round, I doubt he gets past the Columbus pick at slot 37.
