Large wing  who has size, strength, a hockey head and outstanding hands at the Division One level. Good playmaker who moves well. Is an above average passer, and has a good backhander, and can play the game with puck while moving at his top speed. Good on his skates and has a strong stride, and also as good a short touch passer as you will see.  If he chooses to play more physically, there is huge upside in this large package.
