Heaviest shot in the draft. Power-play general who can skate it out of his zone or be a trailer on the attack. Fluid skater with great feet and balance that will allow him to separate the puck from attackers. A poised player who keeps calm and focused in the heat of battle. Has consistently shown in international competitions that he can play against the best junior players in the world, even though they were older than him.
