Agile three zone centre-forward with speed, impressive puck skills, who plays an aggressive forechecking game, as well as having a strong offensive side. he is a North-South skater who shoots, hits and and finds rebounds and has a solid 200 foot game. Possesses excellent functional strength, good feet and straight ahead acceleration. Handles the bisquit well at top speed, and distributes well. Finishes checks and uses his size in the cycle down low. Aggressively involves himself, as his size may call for him to play with more edge than finesse, but is a dependable positionally sound defensive player who gets asked to shut down the opponents late and on the penalty kill. He is a solid body checker too.  Intriguing long term potential as a power wing with size, offensive upside, and solid two way impact. He was selected to the roster for the World Junior Under-18 Tournament in April.
