Cool, quick-legged, butterfly goalie who displays strong positioning, good balance, and has size to the top of the net. The top goalie available from Sweden. Lets the play come to him, anticipates well, and is pretty agile, so he recovers well. Very sharp and in control during games and forces shooters to commit by being more patient than they are. Gives few rebounds and has great feet to reposition himself quickly. Teams are not only familiar with him because his performance at last summer's Ivan Hlinkla tourney, but also because he was a member of the Shattuck St. Mary's program before returning to Sweden to hone his skills there.
