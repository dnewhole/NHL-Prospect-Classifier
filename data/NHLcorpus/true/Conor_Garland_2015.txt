Small high energy attacking wing who excels in passing the puck and using his dynamic speed to create scoring opportunities. Terrific PP option ala Johnny Hockey. But you can't ignore that he lacks size, strength and the ability to compete strongly for pucks in his end. I don't mean he doesn't attempt taking possession; more that he gets knocked off them and to the ice at times. More of perimeter shooter maybe for his own health. With all said, he still is a more than intriguing draft possibilty.
