At six foot and 190, he is a dynamic scoring wing who just keeps getting scoring chances-- and capitalizes on them. Solid skater with lateral agility, but he isn’t a blazer, so he exploits the seams & soft spots in coverage. Displays quick hands and a scorers mentality, but doesn’t necessarily use his agility as a one trick pony in the attack zone. He is responsible in all three zones and is competitive in backside pressure. His forte is on the power play; he is able to generate chances, get to soft areas, and use his head and hands to shoot the puck. Has a wicked one-timer, and a quick release - cannon of a snap shot. Has been an elite attacker in the QMJHL. Very patient and has a smart sense about where he should be in the attacking zone. He can beat you with a surprising heavy perimeter shot, or simply gets in closer and sniffs around for scores in the area. Seems to swoop into existing puck battles and come out untouched, quickly moving into the blue dot. He makes the goalie start changing his position and takes advantage with his sneaky backhand or quick wrister. He lit up the World Juniors U-20 for Czech with seven goals in seven games at 18 years of age. He has emerged as one of the top picks in the class because his fiery offensive capabilities may continue to develop into the pro game. And I don't think moving him to left wing compromises his ability to score and make plays. A pure shooter, who can change a game with one flick of his wrists..
