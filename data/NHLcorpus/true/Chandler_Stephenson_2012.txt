Undersized speedy scorer who possesses an excellent shot. Strong skater who despite his smaller build can handle action against bigger defenders. He reads the play well, makes the right pass, and works the corner cycle with authority.  Already functionally strong, but he needs to get bigger, because at this point, he projects as feet-and-gun to the high levels.  Will need time.
