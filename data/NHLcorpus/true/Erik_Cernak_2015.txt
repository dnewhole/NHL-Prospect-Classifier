Slovack player who’s seems a long way from being ready and even a pretty long shot of getting his name called in the late rounds. Has great size, but seems to have limited strength. He hasn’t matured enough to think the game well, or anticipate well, or deliver any hits or dish out some physicality in blue paint battles. Seems to have limited upside in that his passes aren’t great, his defensive positioning is average and his footwork needs improvement. A member of his homeland’s team roster for the World Junior Under-20 at Christmas 2014. This is a player who has a chance to be good as long as he plays within the confines of his limitations at this point. he is a long-term development choice, who tops out as a top four defender who plays with robust in his end, and makes the outlet pass, but doesn't have high skill or impact attack skills.
