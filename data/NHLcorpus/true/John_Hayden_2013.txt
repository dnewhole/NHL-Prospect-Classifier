Big-framed centre-wing who plays hard and tough along the wall and in the front. Has a willingness ot block shots and do what he has to to make life difficult for the opposition. He is working on improvng his feet. Crashes the front of the net and causes significant commotion to the defenseman while doing so. Some might question just how much offensive upside he has, but further development may yield a polished and difficult to play against offensive player too. He was selected to the roster for the World Junior Under-18 Tournament in April.
