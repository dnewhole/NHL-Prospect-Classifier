Czech import to the dub who already displays terrific defensive zone tools and has some upside to add the attack component. He is a long strider with a effortless glide and deceptive explosion when it is needed. An agile defender with excellent footwork and defensive awareness. Displays  high end hand-eye coordination, which helps in defending. Smartly boxes out attackers gap control; and positioning; spaces himself off the hip of the shooters and works from there. Makes outlet passes easily and can help his attack by moving in and applying pressure. A work in progress.
