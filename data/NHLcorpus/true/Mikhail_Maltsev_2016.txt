Big Russian centre who has returned from a back injury that put him on the shelf last season. He displays speed, size, skill,soft hands, a strong stride, acceleration, and top gears. Hasnâ€™t shown elite creativity, strong decision making or on-ice vision, but that might develop. Wins the puck and is strong when he has it. He moves well laterally and shield the puck well. You can count on him to plant himself in front the net and using his big body to get opportunities.
