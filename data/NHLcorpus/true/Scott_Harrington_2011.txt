One of the top stay-at-home defenders in the draft. There is upside, but teams will be delighted with the toolbox that he already possesses. He is content being a reliable player who sticks to the phases he knows he can achieve with above average results and makes his team (and defensive partner) better. A big hitter, with really good skating ability, balance and agility. Has a nice shot. Even in the attack sticks to what he knows are within his ability level, and does not try to play beyond his present level. He has upside and is a truly good hockey player with potential.
