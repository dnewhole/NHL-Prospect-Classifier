High quality puck-carrier who is an all compass fleet power-skating attacker who distributes the puck well or just leads the attack. Out of the Kelowna system known for developing all-around smart defenders, he will be on all the scout's radar as the 2012-13 season goes on. Shows good gap control and handles his own end well. Strong & reliable defensively, and likes the physical aspects of his position. Will eventually improve his skills as a point man and PP QB. He was selected to the roster for the World Junior Under-18 Tournament in April and scored an in the crease goal in the Championship game.
