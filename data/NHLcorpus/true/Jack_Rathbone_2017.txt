Undersized defender with good vision, high end skating ability and grit. Very elusive and uses his shiftiness to move pucks out of his zone and unto the attack, which he will hope in on. His low center of gravity gives him the ability to cannonball opponents and knock them off the puck and play.  It also enables him to bounce of contact in his carries. A longer term project that need to work on his decision making and getting faster all around.
