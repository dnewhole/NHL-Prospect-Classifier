Six foot Czech import defenseman who is still learning the North American game. Has good vision and good puck moving ability and good touch on his passes. Good outlet passer on transitions who can thread the needle on the home run blue line pass or short saucers to his closer teammates.  Usually makes the correct  pass coming out and also is a willing carrier up ice. Needs to improve his quickness/reaction times when bad things happen. Loses pucks or erant passes against speedsters/forecheckers. Will need to be quicker in his decision making as he climbs the ladder to higher competition levels.
