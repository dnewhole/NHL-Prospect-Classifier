Impressive big man with good speed and all-compass mobility, and equally impressive offensive instincts. Will fill out to be an even larger pro, he has a nice first step and ability to control play down low and along the boards. A fine scorer with a quick release, he could play in phone booth with success, as he stick handles and moves as well as any smaller skilled forward, but can still beat teams with his power game. He surpassed his rookie point totals in the the first 30 games and looks to be an impressive pro.  He choose to be part of a club which was in a rebuilding mode, and has had to shoulder lots of the weight. Doesn't have the all-out flash and dash of the other early picks, but is an excellent smart player with significant positives and upside. Could go higher than expected.
