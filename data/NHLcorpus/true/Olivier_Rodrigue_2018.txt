Still growing and filling out, the young Q goaltender is very calm and collected in his net. Positionally strong and displays solid rebound control. Quick both side-to-side and up-down as the play is about to come to him. Doesn't let traffic affect his challenging the shot. Keeps his team in games and projects as the top goalie candidate in this class in my opinion.
