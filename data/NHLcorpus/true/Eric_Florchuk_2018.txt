Big Centre-wing whose feet have improved radically in the course of the season. He has improved his skating stride's length to accommodate his longer legs. Very light on his edging and a creative stickhandler. Mystifies defenders and finds his passing outlets after rolling off coverage when his scoring chance closes. Pushes opponents off pucks on the forecheck and any place where he can jump in and can leverage. Hockey smarts and fearless in traffic, has a coasting gear. Really controls the attack zone looks. Far from a finished product as he still needs work in many areas. There is is plenty of upside. He sprouted up a few inches and needs time to fill out.
