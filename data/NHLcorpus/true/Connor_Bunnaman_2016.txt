Can be viewed as a "Christ Tierney"  type player and selection. Doesn't play PP minutes, or compile huge scoring numbers, but plays a pro-style and projects as a third line centre who slide throughout and NHL teams line-up. Smart and competitive, with excellent North-South feet, distributes the puck well on the attack, and does all the things they make forwards succesful. Very strong on his stick, and great on the wall and down low. He plays against the top teams opposing lines and he is good in his own end. Very good in the dot, and he difficult to play against and even contain. You aren't drafting him with the idea he projects as a future top six guy; just a really good driven bottom of the roster competitor who you can trust to be out there.
