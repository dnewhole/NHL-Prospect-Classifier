The bar was set high when he arrived in the OHL because of the high skill levels he brought to the table. He is a 200 foot player with hockey smarts and the ability to make precise passes offensively. Good in the dot and uses his speed in the middle zone, but stalls when he gets in high traffic areas. The team that selects him will encourage a bit more tenacity in his one-on-one puck battles. He might project as a left wing.
