Younger prospect whose played big minutes for Timra in the Allsvenskan. He displays patience when handling the puck and shows some upside as an offensive generator. Strong on the puck, he makes skilled entries and is able to create time and space in the attack zone with soft passes to his linemates. Not a flashy dominant skater. He compensates with strong two-way game and plays solid in all three zones. He drives to the front fearlessly. A leader who elevates the play of the guys around him. Has good balance and hands and wins the one on one battles. Has a hard shot but looks more like a set-up guy. Still in the developmental stage, he doesnâ€™t hurt you no matter what line or situation he is thrust into.
