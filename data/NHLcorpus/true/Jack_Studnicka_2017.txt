Lean two way centreman who leads by example with grit, giddy-up, and great team first gumption. His quick feet get him going and he deceptive slides into open seams looking for the puck. Well schooled and solid in his own end, and is calm and smart during the heat of the play. An unselfish player who will work passing plays from all the areas in front and work the wall and around the horn to unearth pucks too. Although he thinks pass first, he has a been know to surprise with well placed shots while off balance, but was probably looked at as a bottom end centre with his contributions being his strengths and not as a player who would be counted on to score…until he suddenly came on in the playoffs and also with Team Canada at the World U-18s, contributing at a higher rate than anyone had seen until that point. Needs time to develop, and he isn’t a sure thing, but the scoring may improve. He has some skills and good feet, and comes to play a responsible way for 60 minutes, so that makes him a safer selection, albeit one that may not have a high water mark. I see lots of guys making a living in the bigs who fit that very same description.
