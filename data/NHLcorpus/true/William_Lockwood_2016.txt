Displays soft hands, quick moves and a persistent forecheck. Never stops flying around, and is difficult to get a bead on. Handles the puck very well at top speed, and can turn tight and separate from opponents. An under six footer with an average frame, he can be knocked of the puck, but is strong on his skates and the puck most of the time. A battler who plays fast with quick mitts.
