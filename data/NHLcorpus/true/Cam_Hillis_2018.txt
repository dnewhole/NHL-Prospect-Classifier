Undersized centre with skill and decent instincts in the attack zone. Long term project who needs more strength. Not very productive in the dot for a centre. He often gets taken off the puck. He seems to bolt up ice in anticipation to his team taking possession. That means he leaves his check and many times, the pass doesn't come to pass. Needs to improve to a better 200 foot game.
