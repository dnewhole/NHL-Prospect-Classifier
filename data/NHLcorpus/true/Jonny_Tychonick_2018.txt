Another of prototypical new age offense men who stands six foot and hasn’t reached 180 pounds. A riverboat-gamble wild colt who plays that high-risk-high-reward style we see potentially filling the draft’s first round. Has tremendous feet, and is very capable of end to end rushes. Can change the game with a goal or a creative feed for one. A good stickhandler and rusher and has that high-end feel on the attack. Even in tight space, can dangle through seven defenders wondering what just happened. Opens his hips and lets go one-timers on the attack. Will stray closer and closer to the scoring areas until he feels he is going to get checked. Sometimes ill-advisedly thinks he needs to be a one man show; doesn’t use his teammates, the ice, and situations to distribute the puck. He can coming up short and has left his position short of the guy supposed to be playing it. Is timid when he has to go into corners to retrieve pucks or feels footsteps. You would like to see more compete in puck battles in all areas of his defensive zone. There have to be concerns about how he progresses as the competition gets stronger, more physical, and quicker to close space around him. Committed to the University of North Dakota.
