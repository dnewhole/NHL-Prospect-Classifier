San Francisco born, Arizona-raised forward who has size, speed and scoring ability and has displayed it since he was 16 years of age with dominant performances against older juniors. Uses his size and smarts to dominate. If he had been born two days earlier, he would have been the third selection in 2015. A mature player who displays a high skill set, powerful skating feet, and a bigger frame that allows him to make space and breach the offensive zone. Defensively responsible. The NHL players he has scrimmaged with have took notice of his puck-handling, passing, shot and possession skills. He isn’t much an aggressive edging player, but uses his size much like Jonathan Toews uses his size to game advantage. Has played centre and can also easily be projected as a right wing. Clearly appears to be the most NHL-ready of the class due to on & off ice regime, mature attitude to go with a man’s size, high hockey IQ and polished skill set.
