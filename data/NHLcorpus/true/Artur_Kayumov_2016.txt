High speed up-tempo skter who is very shifty and can make plays at top speed. Easily gets separation and generates chances for his teammates. Sees the ice well and has soft hands. Very slight and far from ready. looks like a player a team selects and brings over to the CHL and watches to see if he can develop, get better and develop into a North American wing who actually works the wall and wins puck battles in the battle areas. Right now, he doesn't.
