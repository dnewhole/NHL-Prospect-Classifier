Captainâ€™s a weak Titan team and is good at both ends.  Very thin, but still willing and able to use his frame to knock puck carriers. Maintains good gaps and plays solid despite the lack of depth around him.  At this juncture is more a defense-first place but he may still round out his offensive game.
