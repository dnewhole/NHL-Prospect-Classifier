Sleeper pick in the first. He is one of the best goal scorers in the class, but at this juncture is a lightweight who is tall but thin. Has the frame to carry more girth and may grow an inch or two. Has an excellent wrist snapper he gets off quickly and a booming slapper. He is a really strong skater with good balance and displays good edging that helps him turn abruptly to elude defenders. He isn't afraid to protect himself when he plants himself near the blue paint. A strong skater and very good with his zone entries on the carry in. Really has a good hockey sense and quickly advances the biscuit to create good looks. Seems to capitalize whenever he is able to get loose and get open. He is also a good playmaker and stays involved on the attack. He is at his best when he plays with grit and edge, and his play is trending that way. Has really progressed in his WHL career, but still hasn't reached the 45 goals/79 points in 44 games totals he had in Saskatoon midget, but as he gets bigger and stronger, he may just develop into an NHL power scorer.
