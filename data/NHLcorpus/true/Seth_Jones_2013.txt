The son of former Pro basketball player Popeye Jones  found a love for hockey and is the most fluid defenesman prsopect to come along in awhile. Much has been talked about him as a special player who could become a dominant player at the pro level. All the evidence is not in but so far, he keeps growing-on and off the ice. He plays a strong position game and is very calm and deliberate with his actions. He is deceptively quick but as many big men, he looks nonchalant while plying his trade. Uses his size and his balance in the small battles that can go unnoticed. A very good up-ice passer and skates like a smaller man. Excellent hockey IQ and positionally functional strength. His game is continually improving and may be even bigger by the draft. Doesn't go out of his way to dominate attackers physically but there is some nasty there. When that, and his overall game matures, he may be a dominant NHL player.
