A big-bodied strong player who competes hard game in and game out. Relentless despite having a strong ensemble of players to provide supplementary scoring. Establishes his position using his stature and competitiveness to wins battles and space in the scoring areas. Has soft hands and scoring ability. At times his feet look really heavy and he doesn’t keep them moving. Has the strength to carry defenders with him. Is very difficult  to move him from the crease area on the power play. The skating issues may really hurt his chances because he lacks balance. Takes short strides to his skating and isn’t an accomplished skater to work these issues out in a year with an instructor. Committed to Boston College.
