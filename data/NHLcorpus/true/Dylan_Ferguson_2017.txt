Was actually give the top â€˜tender position while #1 Connor Ingram was away at World Juniors and showed he seemed capable of being the starter with many 40 plus save games and an impressive 6-3-1 record -- even keeping Ingram on the bench after his return from the WJ tourney. He displays good cross-crease movement, rebound control, quick reflexes, an excellent glove hand and nice puck tracking ability.
