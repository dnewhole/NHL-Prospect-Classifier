Centre with good puckhandling skills who likes to be the puck carrier, and offensive generator. Has always been a prolific scorer at the early competition levels.  Good character and competitor who is always called upon to be on the ice to bring his team back from deficits, with his speed, lateral agility, and puck skills. Plays big. As many young players, his defensive game needs more commitment, from both on-ice play, to his game analysis and reaction. Committed to the University of Michigan.
