Undersized winger-center with quickness, hands, and an penchant for generating offense. The best player on the Swedish team in the recent World Under-18s, he creates lots of scoring looks shift after shift. A really good stickhandler with excellent lateral agility at high speed. He is a heavy traffic player who can turn a defender  inside out, go wide and then cut in or simply keep backing him up. Gets separation with his carries and is willing to finish checks, or take a hit to make a play. Very fast when he gains possession in the corner on the attack. Displays a strong snap shot, and fast hands when setting up his linemates.
