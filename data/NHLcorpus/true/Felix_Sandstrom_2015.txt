Another solid Swedish goal prospect who has flexibility, great mechanics, solid positioning  and a calm demeanor. As with many Euro-tenders, he sometimes gets under the bar. Has displayed the ability to stop breakaway shooters coming in one on one. Difficult to beat low, and very quick reactions to the play. This season was not best due to mono and various injuries.
