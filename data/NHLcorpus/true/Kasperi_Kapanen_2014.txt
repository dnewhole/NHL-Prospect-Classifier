He was selected to the roster for the World Junior Under-18 Tournament in April. Saw time on the Finnish first line, where he did set up a few scoring chances and also display good responsible work in his own zone. Son of Sami. His Bloodline will call on many scouts to make decisions on just where he fits on their draft boards. So far he looks like a long term project that has some abilities but is still a bit tentative in his play, unwilling to pay the price to make the play.
