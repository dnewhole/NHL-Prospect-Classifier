One of the younger draft eligible defensemen in the class, he is a terrific skater with plenty of offensive skill and a good enough stick to get things done in his own end. He will have to get thicker and more muscle but has great feet and hockey IQ, so don't count him out as a player just because he hasn't matured completely. Quick on ice thinker who is an excellent stickhandler to blend with his quick feet and shiftiness. Aggressive powerplay point man with a big time wrist shot, and moves the puck quickly and efficiently on the man advantage. At times was a one man show in the Five Nations Tourney, where he gained the zone easily and fly with the bisquit on his blade.
