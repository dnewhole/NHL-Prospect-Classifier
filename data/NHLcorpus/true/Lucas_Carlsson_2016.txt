Strong 200 foot defender good speed, passing ability and plays in all situations. Not overly large, and loses many one on one battles because of it. Very calm and composed with a good head to making the right defensive plays. Has a ways to develop and has a frame that will oblige. Not a true mailman with the puck, but has some upside.
