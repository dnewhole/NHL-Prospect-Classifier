Good playmaking defender with a bit of physicality, and a willingness to push on attackers. Pivots well to the back pedal, funnels attackers to the outside. He needs to get stronger to take on opponents and must read and react better so his passes arenâ€™t anticipated. He is a good puck handler who makes sound exits in transition when he has time. Currently a pass- first type player and he needs to start letting it go so opponents must think he might not pass on some plays.
