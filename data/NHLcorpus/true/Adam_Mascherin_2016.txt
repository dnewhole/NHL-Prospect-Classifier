A sleeper drafted two season back by Florida. Decided to let him re-enter the draft since other NHL clubs didn't offer the second round pick they invested in his selection. He can thread a soft pass or score with his accurate heavy wrist shot. A short, thick centremen who bowls his way around the attack zone. Displays good skills in the attack zone. Not agile laterally or a blazer, he is an excellent North-South skater with speed and will push through defenders if he can find a path around. Strong on the puck in his carries. Displays excellent vision to make plays with his soft passes or his quick trigger. Needs to work on understanding defensive zone positioning. A work in progress that may not be tall but certainly is a tank.
