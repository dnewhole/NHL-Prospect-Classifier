The biggest differences between this undersized, fast, and skilled offensive defender, and the players surrounding him in the rankings is that he's a left shot and is a very responsible in his own end. He already defends better than Boqvist and Hughes... despite his undersized frame. Another elite skater with terrific edge work and poise beyond his years. Needs to get thicker and stronger, but has learned to play nimble and smart against the bigger attackers. He handles the puck at a very high skill level and lights it on his stick. A tad under six foot and about 175 pounds, he manages to elevate his game and play a solid 200 foot game despite his limitations. Before February 1st he was at a point per game pace in the Dub. A character player, offensive generator, and PP QB.
