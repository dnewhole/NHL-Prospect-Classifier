Big impact defender who some have categorized as a power play specialist, although I think that is understating his overall game and upside. Has been at the top or close to the top in defenseman scoring this entire year in the OHL. He was named captain of his club, and plays really smart in both ends. Has good balance and good four-direction skating ability, despite not being categorized as an agile lateral mover with a big burst up ice. Thinks the game at an elite level, and in March was leading his team in scoring. Has little problem getting involved up ice on the rush and is very comfortable using his skill set and decision-making to create from the blue line. He has an excellent hard point shot, but always looks for the best pass too. Skates a bit upright, but it doesnâ€™t hamper his vision or coolness in his own end and when things are starting to develop on the offensive. The sport has reached a skill level where there is a division that separates the position of defenseman into two distinct type styles, and at this point, Bouchard falls into the "has decent size and power, but lacks that lightning speed" side. Still developing, he projects as a right-side backline leader who continues to grow his game to where he achieves high pair NHL status.
