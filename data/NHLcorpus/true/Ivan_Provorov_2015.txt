A strong elusive skating puck carrier who is also great with his stick as a defensive weapon. This improving six foot skates head up with confidence great knee bend and drive, holding that extra second and always aware of all his passing options. Attacks with shake and bake head and body moves and gets by defenders on the attack. Reaches quickly on defense. Still needs polish defensively but has upside that will most certainly have his name called. A member of his homelandâ€™s team roster for the World Junior Under-20 at Christmas 2014.
