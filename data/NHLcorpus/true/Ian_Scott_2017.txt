Big goaler with very good hand-eye coordination, strong fundamentals and technique. Moves well for such a young prospect whose been asked to shoulder the load of a young midlevel WHL team. Well balanced with long arms. Keeps his hands above pad level and has the size to take away the top of the net while shuffling side to side cross crease on his knees with pads on the ice. Keeps his shoulder square to shooters. Cuts down angles, and uses his stick to cover the five hole and redirect pucks into the corners. Excellent prospect.
