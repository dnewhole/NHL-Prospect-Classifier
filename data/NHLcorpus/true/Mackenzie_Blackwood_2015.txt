Tall acrobatic netminder whose aggressive style includes super-quick leg and mobility. Moves really well from side. Loves to challenge shooters and gets out on the edge of the paint to cut down their net. Aggressive goalie prospect whose is very athletic, acrobatic, and positional sound at the junior level. Always ready to challenge attackers and has lightning quick less that stop the low shots with regularity. His big frame and natural mobility allow him to slide from post to post easily. Already had soft pads that help control rebounds. Will need to work on his puck-handling but he seems guaranteed to have his name called early this Spring.
