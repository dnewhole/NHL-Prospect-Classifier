Far from the finished product,this under 6 foot defenseman is an excellent stickhandler and smart with puck distribution. Excellent PP guy. Makes the long stretch pass. His skating leaves much room for improvement, and improved leg strength will help a bit with that. Won Minnesota's Mr Hockey award. His father played pro hockey.
