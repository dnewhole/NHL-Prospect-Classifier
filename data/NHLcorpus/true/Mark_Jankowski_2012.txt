Largely ignored by possible Canadian Major Junior leagues since he was much smaller, but then when he suddenly shot up in size, his skills weren't defined. Now he is a draft wild card that may even sneak in tho the early round. He has super-strong hockey bloodlines, as his great uncle is Red Kelly, his grandfather was a long time pro player then scout, his father was a college player and coach, and his uncle was a Montreal scout and assistant GM. Skilled center with excellent vision, poise, and speed. He hands the puck off as well as any prospect in this draft year. If he was born a couple days later, he would have had to wait until the 2013 draft to hear his name. High character athlete with a hungry competitive nature, and strong work ethic. Good stick and good hands, and skates with a smooth, long stride. Rising prospect may reap high rewards a few years down the line.
