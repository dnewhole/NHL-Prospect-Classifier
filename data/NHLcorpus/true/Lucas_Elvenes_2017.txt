Power play producing centre-wing who has terrific hands in the tight spaces and around the net. Creative with a quick stick, fast soft hands and good anticipation. A natural goal scorer, with great control at top speed. Can separate when going North-South and quickly go laterally East-West when it's man to man. Can place the puck to the other side with the cross-ice pass with accuracy. Good on the give and go. Has top end acceleration and great first step. Needs to use his feet as a means to grow into a 200 player. And he needs to get thicker and stronger. There is no denying he is usually the most skilled guy on the sheet. Needs to sue his gifts as a 200 foot player who hustles shift after shift.
