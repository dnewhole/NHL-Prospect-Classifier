Very safe, early pick. Big skilled defender with calm demeanor, upsize ability, and a bit of snarl. Teams drafting early will see him as a complete package defender who almost certainly fills one of their top four for many years. With the big three forwards all showing tiny parts of themselves that might cause early selectors to shy away from them, this kid has little anyone can have misgivings about. If a team feels defense is where they need upgrading, they may call his name very early. It remains to be seen if his decision to return in 2011-12 to Sweden to play for Skellefte√• in the Elitserien will impact his selection since a team picking high may want him making his adjustment to North American smaller rinks starting sooner instead of later.
