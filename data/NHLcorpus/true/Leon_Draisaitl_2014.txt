German import who is his second season in the "dub" adjusting to the North American style, which his seems tailor-made for his big-framed offensively aggressive style. Not a fighter or pounder, but plays to his size as offensive playmaking centre-wing. He will strat as a centre but may find time as a wing. Displays good balance and plays strong on the puck. A good set-up man who also can quickly get off the puck too. He may need to continue improving his speed and add strength to make even bigger impact. A North-South skater who does have decent stick-handling skills. He is tall and will get thicker. Projects as a top ten pick early on. He was selected to the roster for the World Junior Under-18 Tournament in April, 2013.
