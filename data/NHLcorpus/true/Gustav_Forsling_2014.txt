Stood out at the World Junior U-18 as a future offensive contributor from the backline. A good puck mover who has a cannon that he lets go from both the point and when he moves up into the play. Displays  veteran-like recognition in his reads and his ability to hold possessions in the defensive zone. Will need to make huge strides the weight room in order to handle NHL defensive duties. Is very aggressive defensively and can close down on attackers entering his defensive zone. But his lack of elite quickness and defensive girth may limit his projection as a pro.
