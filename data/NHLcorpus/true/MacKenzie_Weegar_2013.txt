Second year eligible smaller defender who possesses strong offensive ability and an excellent point shot, and keen hockey sense. Good skater who will jump in or lead the rush. Strong passing skills, and PP QB. Was part of a Halifax Moosehead team that won the Memorial Cup. Needs work on his strength and physicality in his own end.
