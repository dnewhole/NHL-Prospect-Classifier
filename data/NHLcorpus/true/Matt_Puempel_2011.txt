Top skill wing of the draft, whose acceleration, lateral quickness, touch and shot put him in line to be drafted early as he begins to put his game to work on a consistent basis. Well built, but still needs to get stronger. Pretty much a natural in the offensive zone because he has a nice feel for play there. He has a tremendous heavy shot, and a player who is good in tight spaces. He still needs to commit and be schooled in the nuances of the defensive zone, and gain the desire to battle for lost pucks in the offensive zone.
