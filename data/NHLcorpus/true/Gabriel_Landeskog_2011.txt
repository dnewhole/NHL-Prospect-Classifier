Excellent wall player, with a great attitude that only increases the enthusiastic play of his teammates. The Swedish import is starting to fill out and has displayed the tools necessary to climb the ladder to the pros, as he already captains his Kitchener OHA team. Will hit, pass, score, and fight. Will bring feistiness, and a power wing package to the NHL, with the biggest question being if he can become an NHL money scorer. No holes in his defensive game either as he'll get back and get involved with blocks, hits and puck battles.
