A give-no-ground good skating defender from the WHL. An offensive defenseman whose defensive game will improve as he continues working hard at the little things.  He is working at being a better shut-down player. Already a very polished transition player, due to a good jump and excellent awareness of when to take off and create a mismatch. Already an outstanding point man, as he effectively reads and reacts with pro-like passing ability. He has a great feel about where he can distribute the puck and give his teammates the best scoring opportunities. Positions himself well in his own zone and can return aggression if necessary.
