Big sturdy D-man with significant upside on both sides of his game. Is a quick-stick player who loves to turn it up-ice and go. Plays with calm and confidence, especially when on the point, setting up the attack. Shows good quickness straight ahead, but needs better lateral agility, footwork,and gap closure. Projects as a second pairing NHL defender with ruggedness and good passing skill. He needs to handle the outside rushes and improve his gap control, as the faster NHL players will be a challenge, if he doesn't. His PP cannon shot seems to have a mind of it's own. He could end up a big punishing-type defender, and there is plenty of upside for him to pass that watermark. He was selected to the roster for the World Junior Under-18 Tournament in April.
