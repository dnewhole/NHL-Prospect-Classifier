Another of the top four Swedish blue liners that wowed at the Under-18 Five Nations Tournament. Ranks right up there with the other three in terms of effectiveness up and down the sheet. Plays a simple game but has no qualms activating in a less spectacular fashion than the others. Displays a high IQ in the defensive zone. Has quick feet in transition up ice and back down to his end, backing up the attack. Makes good breakouts and anticipates where the plays are going. Has work to do on his gap control as he gives attackers too much time and space. Has a long reach which impedes attackers and helps reach errant passes and pucks.
