Rising offenseman who, so far, has shown little snarl in his own zone, but is a constant threat in the attack zone. Needs to get (and play) bigger and better in his own end. A balanced strong strider, and a good carrier with a bit of jump. Like many young D-men, there needs to be improvement on his play in his end, but there is no denying that he is a fearless attack player with great size.
