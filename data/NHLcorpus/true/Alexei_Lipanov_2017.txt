Solid centreman with height but a need to get thicker. He is equally strong as he is an offensive generator or scorer. Very agile and quick, but also has great acceleration and sends opposition defenders to their heels as he blows by them on the attack. Creates chances for himself and linemates with his ability transition North-South in a hurry. In the 8 Nations Ivan Hlinka, he centred Russiaâ€™s top line between Chekhovich and Svechnikov.
