Was already a presence on D at the 2011-12 World Juniors, where he was the right point-man on the number one power play, and was asked to step up and fill in at a spot usual occupied by the older junior defenseman. He is big, physical and skilled, and has a low-panic level and shoots the puck hard and fast. He is very mobile and agile as an attacker and power-play pointman. He already plays in a league with grown men and successfully competes. Gets used on both points on the power play. You may not be getting an elite up-ice guy, but more of a highly capable two-way guy who will surprise you when he jumps up into the attack. One of the top defensive prospects of this class and clearly one of the bigger bodies.
