Bloodlines are where Sam Reinhardt's resume start. His father,Paul, played in the NHL, and his two brothers have already been drafted, and he could turn out to be the best of the bunch. Critics may try to dissect his skating, his physical strength and size, but he is an all-around impact player with vision, excellent playmaking skills, and some grit.  Great hockey IQ and diagnoses things so well in the attack zone. Is quietly developing a strong 200 foot game and has a quick stick, good lateral quickness and good diagnostic skills. Good on the wall. A strong set-up man who understands the attack zone but also can score. Goods hands, agility, offensive skills, and exceptional on-ice vision. Not super quick but reads and reacts in all zones. Displays a quick stick, and good on the wall. Not the biggest guy, but unafraid to hold his own against most opponents. He was selected to the roster for the World Junior Under-18 Tournament in April, 2013. Projects as a top six centre-wing.
