High skilled elite forechecker who unearths pucks and scores by driving into the faces of the opposing defenders and contesting for pucks that should has never gone to him. A puck hound who will take the biscuit and ramp to top gear, then be in position for his own rebound. He seems to ramp up when there's a hint of being part of an odd man break -- as if he smells blood. Goes wide with the puck far from the opposing defenders and turns back in to the scoring area. He also will gain the line and weave, so his second and third layers of teammate/attackers can join in. Decent player in his own end; positions himself well and blocks shots. Can take the the hard pass at top speed and also surprise defenders who think the puck is safeâ€¦until he steals it back.
