Great skater with strong puck handling ability and all around smarts.  Nasty to play against and pounds the enemy relentlessly. Makes a solid first pass. Has a quick release. Strong on his pins and is willing to pinch in and then battle through defender after defender and make point of blowing them up. In his own zone he makes a point to explode in contact behind his net, and opposing forwards donâ€™t like venturing into his side of the ice. Utilized his defensive partner when under pressure. May be an up and comer
