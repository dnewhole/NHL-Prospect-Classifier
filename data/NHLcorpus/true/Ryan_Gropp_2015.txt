Has the frame of a power forward and excellent leg drive and balance. Has good speed and scoring ability. Well disciplined and deliberate on the attack and in his own zone. shows promise as a future sniper. He gets to loose pucks and uses his balance to win along the wall. There are long spaces when he seems to do little to impact a game despite his speed size and abilities. Still needs to improve his work in the defensive zone.
