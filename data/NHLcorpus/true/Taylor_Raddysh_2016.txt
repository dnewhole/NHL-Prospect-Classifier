Bullish winger who goes to the battle areas. A playmaking winger with a accurate release and heavy shot. Smart and positionally sound, he has a bit of edge and decent puck skills. Displays good vision and patience in his carries. Holds until the right moment, whether it be a carry off the wall and a quick pass, or as he sees linemates getting open. Has decent balance and movement but needs to build his acceleration and stop/start quickness.
