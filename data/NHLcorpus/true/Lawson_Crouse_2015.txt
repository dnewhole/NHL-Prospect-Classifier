A big man with an excellent size/skating package. Gets in quickly and handles the forecheck and control the play along the boards. Can control things in the crease area, and has a big time heavy shot and release. Is strong on the puck, and gets through contact, and can drive the net. Very high hockey IQ, and anticipates the play well.
