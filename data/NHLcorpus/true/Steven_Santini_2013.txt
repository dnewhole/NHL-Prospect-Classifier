Potential shut-down defender who takes care of his end with an edge. He is big, strong and effective. Possesses a physical demeanor that he uses to stop the opposition. Not afraid to drop'em. Has a hard point shot, and also is very good as a point passer. A smart player who reads and passes the puck well. A horse who plays big minutes and has untapped offensive potential. His work on defense is stand-up. He closes gaps and stands up many an attacker with checks. He was selected to the roster for the World Junior Under-18 Tournament in April.
