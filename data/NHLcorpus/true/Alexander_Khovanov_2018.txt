Flying a bit under the radar because the Q import was sidelined with Hepatitis C until almost January. Played slow and looked out of place during increased playoff pace. That might hurt his chances of wooing a team's scouting staff into taking him early. Takes needless penalties and didn't show much commitment, coming in out of shape. Initially looked like he might be a first rounder.
