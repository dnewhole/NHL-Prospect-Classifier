Top goaltender in this draft, who has good size, advancing technique, and upside. Covers lots of the net because of his size and playing square to the attacker. The reason he isn't rated as high as a first rounder is because he has tended to become a guesser and shows a lack of consistency due to his losing track of the puck and poor sizing up of the ensuing play. That doesn't mean he isn't a promising prospect though, because he does display a very large, mature and calm presence in the net.
