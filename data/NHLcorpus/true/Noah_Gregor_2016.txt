Undersized centre-forward with great skill and ability to generate offensive. Has high end attack instincts and the ability to create on both the PP and even strength. Not the biggest guy or the strongest skater, but he has a knack for finding the the right area with his quick smart passes and shots. A player still in the developmental stage. many areas are going need to improve to continue his upward spiral.  Has a quick stick recognition skills and ability to get loose. His defensive game is a work in progress, but can't be accused of not given effort in all three zones.
