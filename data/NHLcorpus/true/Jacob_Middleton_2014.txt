A big defender who has excellent mobility, size, and snarl. Has good feet and pivots for a bigger man, and was strong and mean along the wall. Seems like more of a development pick at this point. He hasn't figured out how to use his speed to pressure and close as well as he should, and if he can improve on the back end and add some offense, I suspect he will climb the boards.
