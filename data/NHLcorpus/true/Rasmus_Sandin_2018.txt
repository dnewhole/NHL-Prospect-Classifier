First year import who had the luxury of spending his season on one of the strongest teams in Canadian junior hockey. Has shown he is capable in all three zones, with really good hands that aid his alluding forecheckers and in his receiving hard passes. Although not a high end skater or overly agile East to West, he shows upside as puck carrier and attacker. He is a decent skater with a good sense of awareness and understanding of his end. Though he is new to the smaller ice surface, he can make the stretch pass. Will close off the wall with his body, and isn't afraid of contact. Smart defensively, as he picks his spots, when to pressure and when not to. Good at knowing his check as the attackers keep moving in and out of areas. Confident in his game and will carry the biscuit until he finds the right pass, without get it taken away. Not the finished product, he needs to improve his edging and strides in order to be faster and add some lateral mobility. Has nice long term potential.
