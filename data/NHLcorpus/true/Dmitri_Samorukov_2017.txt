Thin six foot off side defender who can play cool and patient in his end, but also will start running around a bit. He is good at finding the transition breakouts, and was possibly the best Russian defender last August in the Ivan Hlinka Tournament. Projects as a major power play point man with an accurate shot from both the point and when he moves up into the slot area.
