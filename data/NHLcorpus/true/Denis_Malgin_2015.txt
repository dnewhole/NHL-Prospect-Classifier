A small dynamic Swiss scorer whose attack skill cannot be left unnoticed.  A member of his homeland’s team roster for the World Junior Under-20 at Christmas 2014. Still weak on the draw and undeveloped physically, he does see the ice very well and is very shifty, using his vision and stick-handling skills to imaginativey set up linemates. Isn’t strong on the puck and looks as if he presently plays a soft game, but his bread and butter is made with excellent dishes, some at the expense of not taking the shot.
