Mobile defenseman whose up-ice game is far more polished than his back end play. Has good size, hands and feet. Fairly new to the defense position since converting from forward. Projects as a long term project that must learn the defensive nuances of his zone and improve his play in his own zone. Good puck carrier who has excellent hands and passing skills and advanced to being a regular on the point of the Icedog PP, and playing big minutes each game.
