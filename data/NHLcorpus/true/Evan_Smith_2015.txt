Six foot six goaltender with long legs and athleticism who blocks much of the open net in the theme re-occurring over and over in the pro game. A knee injury had him off the map for a while, but is now back closing up the bottom and covering the top. Far from a finished product, he needs work on his rebound control and redirecting shots with his pads.
