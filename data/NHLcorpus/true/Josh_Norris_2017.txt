Rangy centreman with a long stride who projects as a physical two-way centreman. Strong on the wall, battle areas, and in one on one battles. Good in the dot. Works well down low. Always goes full tilt, never quitting. Will throw pucks at the net from anywhere and then proceed to shake things up looking to retrieve it. Does not have tricky stickhandle moves or slick skating moves, but projects as a pro centre. Committed to the University of Michigan.
