Undersized Czech wing who displays creativity, slick moves and excellent passing skills. Not the fastest guy, but one who comes out of high traffic areas with the puck on his stick, and the soft hands to get it where he wants.  An excellent playmaker with a quick wrister.  Not fast, just slippery, and agile, he is deadly on the rush, making monkeys out of the defenders who attempt to close in and stop him. Has patience, vision, playmaking skills, a nice saucer pass, and good awareness. A member of his homelandâ€™s team roster for the World Junior Under-20 at Christmas 2014.
