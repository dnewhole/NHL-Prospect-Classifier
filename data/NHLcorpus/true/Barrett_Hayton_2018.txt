Big kid who continues to show a high skill set and a dedication day-to-day to improve on his last performance. A complete player who takes pride in his 200 foot game, has high hockey IQ, and solid playmaking ability in the attack zone. He has little trouble finding and feeding his best option in the offensive zone. Plays both PK and PP. Three inches smaller than Jordan Staal -- a player he compares to nicely. There is plenty to like about him in terms of his commitment and continuing improvement. You draft him knowing he doesn’t project as a top line impact center; just a guy the coach will love because he can play in all situations and slide in anywhere in the bottom nine and make the guys around him better. Selfless, serious, high IQ guy in the offensive end, drawing more than one attacker to him, only to deceptively get the puck to an open teammate. He is a scoring threat every shift with his heavy shot, but isn’t gonna wow you. He quietly and effectively gets his job done in all three zones or with his snap shot.
