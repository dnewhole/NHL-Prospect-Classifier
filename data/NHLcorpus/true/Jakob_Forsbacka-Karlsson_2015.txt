When he left Sweden for North America, we viewed him a one of the top two-way centres that would be available this year, but he seems to have stalled in attempting to reach his high water mark offensively. Donâ€™t get me wrong: the team that selects him get a strong two way pivot who is smart, dependable and willing to do all the little things need to be done, never slacking in work ethic. He blocks shots, and will relish being the guy supposed to defensively shut their top centre late in the game. He does carry the puck well and also can make those high end plays with terrific passes to his wingers. It may be that he has taken it upon him self to do too much, but he is forcing plays and has declined in ability confidently make that simple play, sometimes over-thinking things and having plays broken up. Needs to pick up his pace and intensity. He was selected to the roster for the World Junior Under-18 Tournament in April. There is still a lot to like as we watch his progression before the Spring.
