Reliable two-way forward who diagnoses well. Team leader and hard worker who shows some grit. He is good with the puck on the fly and plays solid defense coming back. He really hasn't shown much goal production this season, but that doesn't negate the upside that is there. Excellent forechecker who might improve as he gains strength. At the CHL Prospects Skills Competition he tied for the most accurate shot, but lost the tiebreaker.
