While still being eligible for the draft class, that didn't stop him from centering the first line of Sweden's World Junior Tournament silver medal winning team. Dependable, reliable and responsible are what scouts thought a year ago, and only solidified that opinion this season with strong work in the faceoff circle. Decent use of his size, skating ability and smarts while on the ice. Very versatile as he can line up at any of the three forward positions, the power play, and  penalty kill. Works hard, drives the net, pressures the opposing defensemen, and creates turnovers. Drives to the net, and is decent in the defensive zone. The team that takes him is making a safe selection based on his all-around attributes that point upward.
