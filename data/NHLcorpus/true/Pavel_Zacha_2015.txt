Big man who has a strong physical game, excellent hands and really good shot. Not the fastest guy at this point but very strong on his pins and well balanced, and uses his size and reach to wear down the opponents. Good in the battle areas and goes hard to the front. At this juncture prefers to hold the puck, try and deke out  defenders and shoot than to look for linemates. His arrival in the OHL will be his chance to get better all around, and build an even stronger game., and he has shown solid performances at both ends. Plays major minutes, and despite not being a dazzling stickhandler, still manages to dominate and take opponents off the puck, with strong wall work. He plays strong on the puck and never stops working. Displays a quick release and hard heavy shot. He sees the ice, gets open and has at times, high end touch with his passes along with that vision. Even though he may get projected as a future NHL winger, he is for lack of a better name a "shoot-first" centre. This unselfish team first player continues to improve his skating but, at this juncture, where his feet are may determine where he eventually gets selected. Can he improve and be a first line NHL player? That's the question. A member of his homelandâ€™s team roster for the World Junior Under-20 at Christmas 2014.
