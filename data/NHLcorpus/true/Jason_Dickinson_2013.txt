Excellent long-term prospect who is an excellent stickhandler and skater with offensive skills. he has a deceptive skating stride and can lull defenders and then by-pass them. Goes to the net.  A strong shot-blocking penalty-killer. Needs to get stronger to be a thicker player and a more powerful shooter. Has that instinctive ability to score and make things happen. Can pass the puck extremely well. Has show high end ability but only in spurts, and lacks complete game constistency and pop. Needs strength and more girth. He was selected to the roster for the World Junior Under-18 Tournament in April.
