What else can I say that hasn't been said about Rasmus Dahlin. The team selecting first overall will not hesitate at the chance to select who might be the best prospect at the defense position in the last decade. It's easy to argue that most National Hockey League teams really don't have true number one defenseman, just players talented enough to play big minutes and do a decent job. Some of these number one defenders are average or under-sized players that push the pace and do a decent job in their own end. This young man, however, is capable of being a true number one, based on his stature, terrific puck skills, four-way skating ability, and an edge that sets him a notch above rookie status the first time he hits NHL ice.
