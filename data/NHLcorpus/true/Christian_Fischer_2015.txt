Naturally strong lunchpail wing who does have good feet and power wing capabilities. Wonâ€™t blow opponents over with his puck handling of decks. He understands his role. He works the wall gets the puck to his skilled linemates and relishes his chances to stand in front and get rewarded. Pretty selfless and willing the muck it up to get things going. Committed to University of Notre Dame.
