Long term development player who seems to have flat lined and never started a developmental improvement climb from his horrendous plus minus numbers, and lack of defensive zone positioning. Little improvement of that short choppy stride he has. Combine that with blind passes and lack of toughness as a defender, teams will need to see more positives to think twice about using more than a very late grab bag pick to try and develop him.
