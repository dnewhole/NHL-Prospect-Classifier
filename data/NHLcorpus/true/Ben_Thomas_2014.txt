A strong two-way defender with size, skills and a very high compete level. Excellent puck handler with soft hands and the skill and initiative to use his quick start ability to handle things solo. Developing power play guy, he uses his quick stick and body to break attacks up. Needs work on his back ward skating game. Not shy at shouldering the play at both ends.
