Longer term prospect who is committed to Brown University.  A drive to the net, handle the boards guy with physicality, size and girth. His strong body and build already work well and co-ordinated with his feet. Granted, it takes a couple strides for him to get to top speed, but once going he has a powerful stride and balance that make him difficult to derail. Will get bigger and stronger. It's not like he doesn't have moves, scoring ability or power at the present New England HS level. Plays nonstop and you know he is out there, especially if you are the opposition.
