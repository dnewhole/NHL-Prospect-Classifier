Chippy son of former NHLer, Curtis, is an irritating forechecker and disrupter in all three zones. Projects as a future energy player in the bigs if he continues to improve his agility, crisp edging, and lateral explosiveness. Has excellent hand-eye coordination, picks pucks out of the air, and turns them into possessions. He effectively tips in his teammates shots when he sets up as a screen in the paint area in front. Is a great counter player from the middle zone. Has lateral explosion and holds the puck until the opposition starts to close down on him; then his pass will find itâ€™s target while he is in mid-flight. His lateral movement skill and feet are used in his efforts behind the goal line, throwing the defenders in a tizzy with his carries. Make no mistake though; he earns future paycheck with his second efforts in front by creating traffic and his puck battle wins there and in other battle zones.
