Smaller late birthday winger who suffers from the fact he isn’t all that big. He possesses so many tools that might help him overcome his size limitations. Has a top end separation gear, and an excellent starting burst. A superb passer who threads the needle with the puck while on the move. Has finally had the luxury of a no-injury season, and he has now grown his game…one which sees him in perpetual motion, sustaining pressure and looking to ferret out rebounds.
