A huge defenseman who season was marred two shoulder surgeries. Has fallen behind in terms of development, but has displayed good work in his own end with decent physicality and hard play in front of his net. Knows his present limitations and plays inside them. His feet need work but his active controlled aggression may get his name called out.
