Scoring wing with change of pace speed, deceptive shooting skills, and the willingness to play in the dirty areas. Very responsible in his own end and is strong on the puck when carrying. A difficult player to contain when he is on his way to the net, because his determination drives him. Hard worker who has excellent vision, quick feet and lateral agility, as well as a fearless demeanor as he finishes his checks. Always moving and looking for rebounds and deflections. Has little problem in traffic, and causes headaches to defend against, as he owns the wall and front, and makes no friends along the way. Despite looking young in the Swedish pro league, he is a hugely aggressive forward with tremendous upside.
