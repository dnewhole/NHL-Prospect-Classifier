The physical left winger had a strong 70 point season in 2011-12 and a good playoff. Solid frame,quickness, and big heavy shot. Projects as a bottom end player with scoring ability and upside. Was hampered by a ankle sprain for a significant portion of the schedule. It was easy to see how impacted the way scouts saw his skating ability, but he is a North-South player on a bad team, whose skating HAS improved a lot. Really strong on the puck, and his skates, with good hands and passing ability. He sees the ice well, and can throw a really hard it too.
