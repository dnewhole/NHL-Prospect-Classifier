Long term developmental cente-wing with a solid skill set. Has nice hands and very good feet, playmaking ability and a high compete level. The issue is that he needs time to get bigger. Should add to his frame so he can be able to handle physicality and win puck battles in the battle zones and on the wall.  Committed to Boston University.
