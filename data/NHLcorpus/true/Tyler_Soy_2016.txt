When you see him on the sheet, he seems younger and thinner than everyone else. Has a really short compact stride and he keeps the feet moving the entire shift. Sees the surface well and is good at positioning himself, and anticipating the possible developing play. Is very undeveloped, and needs weight room work to make him able to compete in so many of the areas he now seems a lightweight in. If he can get stronger, he will be able to compete physcality in the areas necessary, his perimeter shot will get stronger, and he will get better in most areas. Good playmaker who needs much more weight to withstand the physicality his up tempo strong forechecking style causes. He has soft hands, is a good face-off man, and always keeps his feet in motion. Has long term upside, and already shows great hand-eye coordination, moves to the open areas in lanes, and seems to place the puck wherever he iswants it to go. Clearly the team that selects him will wait but there may be a strong payoff as he improves his physical development.
