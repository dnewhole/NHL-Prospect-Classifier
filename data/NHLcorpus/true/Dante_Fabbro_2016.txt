An average framed prospect with a terrific all-around game. His bread and butter is strong feet and four-direction mobility coupled with high hockey IQ puck skills. Poised mailman who doesnâ€™t seem to feel pressure and easily eludes forecheckers. Slick defender whose PP QB skills are excellent. Very creative with the puck on the attack and a very strong skater who can spin off pressure. Has great vision and can thread the needle on the long home run break-outs. Can find the seam and put the puck up ice in transition with regularity. His feet and puck skills help him break up passes, and be an excellent penalty killer. Very confident and fluid in all three zones.
