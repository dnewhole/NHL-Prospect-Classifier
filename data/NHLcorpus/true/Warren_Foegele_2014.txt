Solid two-way winger with good jump. Late bloomer you grew five inches and never got interest from junior teams, but has put up good numbers and impressive full ice game. He disp[lays a long stride with power and really good speed. Fearless in traffic, and also gritty when he doesnâ€™t. Strong lower body and seems strong on the puck at the present level. Has good puck skills and hands. A long term prospect who will need to develop more instinct and grow as the competition does.
