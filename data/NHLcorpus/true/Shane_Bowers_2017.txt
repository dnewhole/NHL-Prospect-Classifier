Highly skilled two way centre that plays a mature 200 game. Has an exceptional hockey IQ and good feet and head. He will slip through the defensive layers to the soft areas and use his quick release to score. He likes the puck on his stick and is a very good passer who is easy for his linemates to follow. He shined at the USHL West Showcase. Still thin, but has room to fill out. The big question is whether scouts and teams see him as a a true NHL second liner or simply with the upside to be a solid 3rd line centre-forward. That, more than anything else, will determine he his name gets called. A very safe pick as the chances are very probable he plays in the league in some capacity.
