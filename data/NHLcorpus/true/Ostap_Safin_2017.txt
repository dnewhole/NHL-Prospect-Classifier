Huge winger who looks the part. Good skater, with solid straight line speed and powerful strides. Good hands and a powerful, heavy writ shot that handcuffs goalers -- especially since he lets it fly from all different angles. Good at handling the puck, or in the cycle, but for such a large guy, he simple is far too soft on the puck and needs to man up and play to his size especially when his team falls behind.
