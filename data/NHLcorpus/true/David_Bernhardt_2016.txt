Solid two-way defender who has a good reach and stick to strip pucks and close lanes. Can be a dominant physical presence and probably need to continue to improve this aspect as his is how his pro bread will be buttered, not as an offense man, although he does have a heavy point shot. He can activate to join the play. Needs to improve pivots as attackers close try and fly-by.
