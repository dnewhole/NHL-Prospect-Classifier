Complete two-way performer with excellent size, skill and skating ability. His performance in the World Junior Challenge may have cemented his first round status. In that mid December tourney he seemed to single-handedly take apart the U.S. entry in all outcomes and all phases with his domination. Plays like it is his last game ever. Has really good size and East-West mobility which he uses in puck pursuit to get it back and get things going again. This big strong horse can force defenders backward and his ability to play strong on the puck has him holding it while teammates are able to find the soft spots. Opposing players tried to knock him off the puck but he keeps control and eventually goes to the net. If the seam closes, he with keep moving in possession until a teammateâ€™s chance opens up. Walks out of the corners in control and hungry. Yet is difficult to project where Russian who are not playing in North America are slotted by the NHL staffs. 	Forward Denis Gurianov and goaler Ilya Samsonov went early in the first, but no other Russian went to mid-third round. It might be safe to say Rubtsov goes somewhere later than Samsonov and before the third round.
