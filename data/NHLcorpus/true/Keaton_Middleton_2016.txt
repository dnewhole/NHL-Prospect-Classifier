Big large defender who improved his four way mobility but still needs to improve his pivots. What you see is what you get: Big man on the backline who uses his size to cover the sheet and punish opponents. He still needs to get a better feel on the offensive side decision-making. Breaks up plays with stick and getting up close and personal. He is a good puck handler and receives fast hard passes well. Speedy players will beat him, and he has to improve his choices on the attack, but there may be a reward down the road to the team that takes time growing his game.
