High tempo Swedish centre-forward with excellent speed, lateral agility, and acceleration. Seems to be very active and involved in all three zones. Strong puck pursuit player who pressures to take the puck back, and very fast and elusive in battle areas and tight places when on the attack. Displays a quick release and strong one-timer. Still hasn't shown a dominant offensive game, but has a great first-step burst and a low centre of gravity. He is difficult to stop or take the puck away from. Always moving and an excellent back-checker with an excellent commitment in his own end.
