Talented centre-winger who is a bit farther away from turning pro, but who displays keen offensive skills. Has superb feet and lateral agility to dart and turn defenders inside out in the attack zone. Displays solid vision and creative play-making, coupled with end to end speed. Didnâ€™t see much playing time in World Junior U-20 but shined at the Five Nations under 18. Has really nice hands and a quick release on his snap shot. Needs to get much stronger, bulk up, and needs to be a 60 minute dominant attacker. So far, his dynamic offense shows, but seems to fade and disappear. He sometimes plays so fast that his take-ways leave his line mates in the dust behind the play. Learning to use his speed, create space, and let plays percolate are what need developing, along with upper body strength.  Not ready to absorb the physicality of the pro game, I would call him a work in progress who has to get better defensively and continue to grow his hockey awareness.
