Has a two way game and his speed lets him pressure on the attack and support on the back-check. He is an example of a player who skates low to the ice and gets to top gear fast. His speed can cause problems to opponents. Being the fastest guy on the sheet doesn't help if you can't handle pucks, distribute them accurately or waiting too long to use your chance. It is not very helpful if you can't play to the speed you are gifted with. Needs to get bigger, thicker and stronger too.
