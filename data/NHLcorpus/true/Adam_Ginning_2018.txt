Big physical defender whose skating, footwork, and pivots improved dramatically over the season. As a defender, he initiates contact, making big hits and rubs out attackers with regularity. Plays big minutes against the better opponents and on the penalty kill. His pivots have shown improvements and he gets on the back pedal tightening his gaps. After transition in his own end, he uses his partner for d-to-d pass and clears his zone effectively with solid outlet passes. Really long-armed and has soft hands with passes and receptions as he moves up ice. Effective and creative with cross ice feeds, jumps up driving the play into the attack zone. This big man reads the offensive end as smart as anyone. Arguably, was the best Swedish player in the Five Nations Tourney. There is long term potential in his selection because he is a player who showed tonnes of improvement in his footwork, and over all agility. He is taking steps in his confidence and involvement in the offensive zone. Upside is there to continue improving past being thought of as a big physical defender with a huge wingspan who handles the puck well.
