Big defenseman with a big point shot. Not necessarily a polished puck carrier, but is surprisingly agile going East-West. He is excellent in his own end to cover attackers and space. Uses his size to win wall and battle zone possessions and will clear the front. No mean streak, but is a really solid competitor for 60 minutes. Plays on both the penalty kill and the power play. Excellent hockey sense and reads his own end well. Stays square on rushers and takes them outside, using his stick to take away their time and space. Very good on his feet and light on his edging, and able to play strong on the puck. Has a good low shot that he places on the net. Needs to fill out and get stronger. The Kelowna system has developed many NHL defenders so he seems in a good position to improve and get selected fairly early. Great bloodlines with his father Adam Foote.
