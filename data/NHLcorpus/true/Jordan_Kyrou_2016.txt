A speed and energy centre-wing who has a good two way junior game, good one on one skills, and goes in looking for pucks. He is strong on hos pins and difficult to contain. Releases the puck quickly with a pair of soft hands, and can play strong on the stick when he has the biscuit. Has displayed some good work in small areas and stuck out in the U-18 tourney as one of the best players. But there is a lack of consistency in his ability to score it may just be a matter of the prospect getting stronger and being able to physically win with regularity. Not really big or physical, not really overly skilled, and it is questionable if he can fill in the blanks in either area to ensure he could be a top six NHLers. Long term developmental prospect who could be a late bloomer.
