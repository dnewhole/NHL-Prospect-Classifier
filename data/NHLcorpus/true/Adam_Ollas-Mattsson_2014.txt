Big stay-at -home defenseman project who has a long reach, and the willingness to use his size to his advantage on all engagements. Makes the simple best outlet and doesn't try to get cute. Not the strongest or quickest afoot, at this juncture, and can have trouble with quicker attackers and can be rattled when under heavy forecheck. He is able to slow play down and looks like a decent long term project on the backline.
