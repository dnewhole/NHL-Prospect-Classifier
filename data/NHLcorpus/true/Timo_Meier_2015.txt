Wide bodied six foot Swiss winger whose improved feet and more robust play in the Q has him in the scout’s sights. Good battle zone player who needs further work on his acceleration and starts. Very skilled but still on the low end of the learning/development curve in terms of thinking the North American game and instinctively reacting. A work in progress who was a member of his homeland’s team roster for the World Junior Under-20 at Christmas 2014.
