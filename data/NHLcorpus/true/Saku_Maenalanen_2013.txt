Second year eligible winger with good feet, burst, agility who has caught up with to his growth spurt and has shed the awkwardness that was present earlier. He was selected to the roster for the World Junior Under-18 Tournament in April, and it provided him with platforn to show his improvements as a possible NHLer player due to his all around versatibilty. big body that finishes checks, and plays a robust all-in style combined with some offensive upside. He may not project as a high end guy, and needs to get stronger, but he may eventually be able to slide up & down through the bottom nine.
