Third year-eligible Pearson developed into an every night competitor with size, good feet, and good offensive abilities off the rush. The puck seems to find him. He is a guy who may be considered average across the board in terms of size, feet, shot, but plays with a determined demeanor. Has good anticipation and a lightning quick release.
