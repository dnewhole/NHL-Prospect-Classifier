Big framed physical defenseman who combines good feet, offensive upside with solid defense. Very composed defender with a poise & calm, a good stick, and some aggression in his own zone. Makes solid contact, and his reach helps break up attacks. He is a solid transition passer, and his skating ability makes him good going back up-ice. Has plenty of room to get bigger and stronger. Watching him as an attacker is why teams are hoping he is on the board when they are picking. He patrols the right point as threat in many ways. His skating ability and balance might have him walk the blue line, and thread the needle with a pass to a forward on the half wall, or take the shot as things open. He is good at holding pucks in on the pinch, and his long reach lets him place them in on the attack effectively. A promising prospect that will get bigger and play strong minutes on a NHL team's defensive pairing. Exactly which pairing he projects to will be determined as he advances.
