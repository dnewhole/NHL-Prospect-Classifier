Continues to impress all watchers with his Ivan Hlinka & World U-18 performances as a 5' 8" defensemen with a big-time point shot, and high end offensive skills. Uses his thick, meaty fireplug body to hit players with authority. Very cool and rarely panics under pressure, always looking for the outlet pass.The stickling point is his size and making it work at the NHL level.
