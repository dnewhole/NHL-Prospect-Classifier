200 foot scoring wing was late birthday who displays good feet. excellent vision, good puck shielding skills, and quick hands. He has battled through many injuries and hasn't shown that offensive upside to the extent that he is capable. Really excellent instincts and superbs hands and wrister. A power player who never stops working, with commitment and smart play everywhere. Plays tough. The only area he needs work in is on one on one battles, but he is instinctive in most phases of the game. Some might cap his offensive upside, but I see an NHL power player in the making.
