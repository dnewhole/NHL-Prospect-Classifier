Undersized defenseman who is excellent mobility an PP QB skills. Advances the puck very well because he sees the ice well. Good in transition. In the attack zone he passes the puck well towards the net. Pinches well. In his own end, he uses his feet to angle off attackers and close his gaps. The issue is his size, and whether he can advance and be successful in the higher levels of play. He has commited to Harvard University.
