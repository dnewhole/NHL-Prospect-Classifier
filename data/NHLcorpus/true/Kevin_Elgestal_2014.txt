Still developing power wing who sets up shop in front and is far from docile in terms of engagement. Didnâ€™t see lots of ice time and is going to need a few seasons to figure out things and add weight and muscle. Need to gain first step quickness, but once in motion, he can get going fairly fast and show agility in his carries. Has a good shot that will improve as he gets stronger. Strong on the forecheck and has some upside as a bottom six winger.
