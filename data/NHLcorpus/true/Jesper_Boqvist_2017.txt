Lightweight, elusivr Swedish winger with great hands and feet. A change-of-pace skater with great balance and ability to change directions. There is a need for him to get stronger and thicker so he doesnâ€™t get knocked off the puck in skirmishes. Displays a high work ethic and the ability to score in so many different ways; he can score with his one-timer in the circles, use his hand-eye coordination and deflect/tip shots, snatching rebounds in front or off the rush.
