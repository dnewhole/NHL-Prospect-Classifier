Another player who cemented his early selection after a terrific showing at the Ivan Hlinka Tourney.  One of the best younger players available, he possesses exceptional playing strength that allows him to play all phases with noticeable magnetism. He clearly is a finisher, but what stands out is his willingness to play with snarl in battle areas and even shows physicality beyond his age. His true talent lies in his strong stride, hands, and snap shot. Needs to add quickness and a stronger first step. Unfazed by contact, he continues rolling through opposing obstacles. May have huge upside as he continues to build his strength and game.
