Strong skating defender with a strong offensive game. Reads the ice well and is a good passer. His all-compass agility allows him time in all zones. Power play pointman with accurate shot. He will need time to develop physically, but it looks like there will be significant payoff down the road. A work in progress, in terms of reacting to quick game decison-making and reacting.  He was selected to the roster for the World Junior Under-18 Tournament in April.
