Undersized forward from an athletic family who is a great skater, excellent on I’ve vision , and shoots the puck very well. One of Kelowna’s key guys when they are killing  a penalty, he is a shot blocker, and can transition those blocks in to short-handed breakaways. In the attack zone, he uses his feet and  and to get behind the defenders. Has a high level hockey IQ, a really good face-off man, vision, and plenty of playmaking ability.  Gets right in on the forecheck, and when he takes the puck away, walks out to the front, and can quickly snap his wrist shot on net. Really strong on the puck down low and on the wall. Has a touch pass. His separation gear causes problems in so many parts of the attack zone. Fast enough to split the defense, get around from the outside, or bust into an open area quicker than expected. Plays like a larger guy in the battle areas and surprises big players when he outmuscles them. Longer term development is needed, but no coach will say he doesn’t leave it all out there.
