It would be easy to look at him and say his most impressive trait is his work on the strong St. John power play, but there is lots to like about him all over the ice. He is a good stretch passer, and handles carrying well too. The strength of his game is his skating. He has a wide base, good balance and a nice stride and acceleration. This gives him an advantage in defensive coverage, and can carry the mail at full speed. Good wrist shot and fine bloodlines.
