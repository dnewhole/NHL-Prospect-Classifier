The USHL top rookie scorer may not be a high end speedster. He does have creativity, high end vision, a good motor, and contributes in many areas. Has a good change of direction and offensive prowess. Keeps his head on a swivel. Comes out of corners creating scoring chances with good passes and lets loose his rocket shot. Still a work in progress who needs to get better all around and stronger.
