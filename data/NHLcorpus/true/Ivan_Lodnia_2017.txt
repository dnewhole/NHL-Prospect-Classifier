Fast, quick offensive generator who passes the puck while displaying high end skill and feet. Is brilliant when he has the puck; an elite passer who can pin-point pass the biscuit while is flight. What he lacks in size he uses his skill and hockey instincts to make up for. Super skilled creative player who has four knocks against him:  1. That he is a one-dimensional player, 2. That he doesn't play with sustained intensity for 60 minutes 3. that he's not committed defensively, and 4. He's an average skater lacking a top end gear. He lacks height but that doesn't get him off the hook to be a better forechecker, back-checker or a puck battler. And he may not be a blazer, but he moves awfully well laterally on the attack. Has a good shot and excellent passing ability. He will need to continue to add strength and two way game including better defensive zone commitment, but looks like a prospect with an offensive nose for the net, and a great feel for getting open offensively.
