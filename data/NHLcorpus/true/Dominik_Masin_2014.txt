Hard-nosed defensive defenseman who is positional strong and aggressive playing inside his limits to stop attackers. At this juncture, is only middle of the road in terms of passing, carrying, and mobility. He manages to do a solid job blocking shots, handling one on ones, clearing the crease, and sealing the opposition on the boards. He takes pucks away and reads play well. Hits with authority and makes the play out of the zone well. It is a question as to whether teams see a significant upside.
