A year ago scored at a point-per-game pace and hasn't slowed much, with 50 points in 55 games this season. Great speed and dangle. Possesses great vision and is an offensive generator. Top-end elusiveness and puck skills. Can go wide on a defender and cut to the front. Needs to build strength and aggressiveness, but does surpirse with some heavy checks. Once thought of as a sure bet first round selection, his development didn't keep keep pace with the strong draft crop. He should start reaching those expectations with more minutes next season. Possesses plenty of skill and traits for a team select him and watch him develop as a scorer as well as a generator.
