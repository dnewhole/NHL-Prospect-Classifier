Under the radar performer who is a terrific skater with strong skill set. His year was marred by various nagging injuries. An average skater who is a good two-way player whether lined up at centre or either wing. He is smart on the ice, good in the dot, supports the puck, shows creativity in the attack. Committed to Boston University where he will hone his skills hopefully ascending to a strong third line NHL centre.
