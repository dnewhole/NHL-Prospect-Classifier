Finnish defender with prototypical size, who plays a solid and steady game with good positioning, good reads, and a quick stick. At this juncture, he  doesn’t project as impact up ice offensive performer, but has many tools that are on an uptick. He is a solid stickhandler and can handle the reception of hard passes even on the fly.  Doesn’t rush in his end when the puck comes to him for its trek back to the offensive side; he will start moving his feet before trying to rush it off his stick if there is the time to start moving out. He then finds the best outlet into the attack zone. Has upside with time.
