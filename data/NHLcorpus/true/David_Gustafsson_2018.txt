No one who views him will see future star centremen or offensive scorer. That being said, they will see one of the most advanced defensive centres in the class. Good balance and feet. Not a guy with a full pallet of acceleration gears. Nor will he set up defenders to reach to him and then see him fly by. He does have a nice stride that keeps him next to his man in coverage and able to win pucks away. Effective on the penalty kill in the Five Nations tournament. So far shows decent hands and a good sense in the attack zone. But, he has displayed a strong offensive repertoire and the same intensity one on one when on the attack. Good long term potential because he thinks the game well, and plays to win.
