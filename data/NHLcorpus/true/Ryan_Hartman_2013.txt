Led the USA-NTP U-17 team in scoring last season. A physical-style player who already understands the nuances of both offensive and defensive coverages, and leads by example. He shows plenty of promise to climb up the scouting lists, because he plays an ultra aggressive style fits NHL playoff style hockey, despite being under six foot. He pressures the opposition in plenty of ways, including those they don't like. Extremely smart and reads the on-ice situations, and will know when to drive the front, when to shoot, and the spot where to get open. Despite descriptions by many as not fast and under-sized, he has exceptional small area quickness in stop and starts and is a strong penalty killer. He can slide back to centre ice if needed, and can play all three forward positions with grit, nasty and enough sandpaper that he can a disruptive force in all three zones.
