Chippy two way winger with offensive skills and good size to impact games. Gives a strong sixty minute effort of solid positional play and effort. Not the fastest guy, but he makes sure he gives effort in his back check and other areas in the defensive zone. Surprised with a solid offensive performance of 46 goals.
