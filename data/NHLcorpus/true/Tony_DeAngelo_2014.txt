Elusive undersized defenseman with a calm demeanor, great wheels, and an really quick stick. A riverboat gambler with exceptional puck skills and lightning hard shot. Game changing talent from the back-line where he has great vision soft hands and the ability to make space. The issue teams will have with him is he hasn't been a very good teammate and that attitude had him sitting out for a bit.
