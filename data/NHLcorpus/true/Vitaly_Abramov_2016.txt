A tiny, fearless high traffic competitor with high end speed, and stick. He is listed as 5’ 9” but is small. Has terrific vision, and handles the puck with it he’s playing the shell game with you. Great hands. Handles the hard pass so well and can touch pass with the best. Piling up both goals and assists in the Q. Very unselfish player who looks for the best option even when he could shoot. Has consistently scored at even strength and on his PP chances. Can undress a defenseman and take him out of the play. Excellent touch passer and even at his diminutive size he has stood up to the rough going. It is easy to argue that part of his success is derived by the linemates he has been gifted. And easy to see how in the past many smaller offensive dynamos end up waiting until later rounds to get drafted. You have to wonder if he is the exception to that rule.
