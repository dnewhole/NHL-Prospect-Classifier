An enormous wing who was the standout player in the United States All-American Prospects game. He has the skills and acceleration that you see in much smaller forwards. Has a very fast game, eg. he moves and acts at a quick pace, and his huge size makes him almost unstoppable, as he can stickhandle in smaller spaces and in a smooth motion take off on the opposition with a power move to the net. Plays hard and will stand in the crease area like an unmovable object. Is good on the entire sheet. He supports the defenseman and is known to dig pucks out of his own end. He’s a Mack truck when he wants to go to the front and has been known to carry defenders along. Certainly not the finished product and there is always the level of competition that you have to weigh against the eyeball test, but you can’t deny the dynamic combination of skill, speed, size, soft hands, reach and quick release that is there. If only he was a little more belligerent, and more difficult to play against. Committed to the University of Minnesota-Duluth.
