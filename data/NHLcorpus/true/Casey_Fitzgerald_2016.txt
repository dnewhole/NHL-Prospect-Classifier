Undersized offensive-minded defender with excellent jump, and quick hands. Is calm and has a strong stick and despite needing bulk and strength, he uses his lateral quickness and puck handling prowess to excel in the two way game. Committed to Boston College, but just might end up in the QMJHL in St. John.
