A late bloomer with good skills, feet, and high end stickhandling ability. Six foot playmaking centre with very good offensive instincts and smarts. Has good vision and sees the open teammate quickly and effectively. Has a good anchor and is strong on the puck. Has a frame that can add weight. Has a terrific stick, and despite knocks on his skating stride by others, he provides scoring chances using his speed and agility. The issue is more if you are able to get value by where he is selected. His lack of production in past years is a troubling aspect if you see him as player who is going to trend upward. As an NHLer, he'll be expected to contribute as a regular contributor offensively. Committed to Providence College.
