Needs very little time and space to let quality chances fly off his stick. He does tend to hold the biscuit and try to one man the play when he could use his linemates. That may be because he has high confidence in his handling abilities, and his ability to put the eventually puck wherever he wants. If he keep his game simple he can be part of a dominating unit. He is great at finding a place for himself in the slot and get his stick on shots or his devastating wrist shot go. Has shown in junior all the attributes you look for in projecting a prospect to the pro game: Speed, power, vision, and high end hands that help him carve the attack zone piece by piece. Has a willingness to work the wall and his reach and speed win many 50/50 puck battles. The only negative might be that his defensive effort has been questioned and that it appears on many shifts, he can go unnoticed or just seems to be invisible. (In perspective, there are very few prospects whom this description doesnâ€™t apply.)
