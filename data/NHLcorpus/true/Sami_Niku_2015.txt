Poised Finnish defender who excellent foot speed and confident puck-handling ability. Reads the situations quickly and makes consistently solid decisions when in control of the puck. An accurate passer who doesn’t get hurried. Is already strong for a six footer and fends of the forechecker on his attempts out of his end. His combination of good feet speed, balance and strength let him knock much bigger players off the puck. Is decisive in his reads and very patient to make the right play using nice touch on his passes. An up and comer. A member of his homeland’s team roster for the World Junior Under-20 at Christmas 2014.
