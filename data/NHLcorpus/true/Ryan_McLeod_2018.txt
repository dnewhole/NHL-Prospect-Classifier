Mikey's Brother is about as fast on his skates as big brother. Big centre with great really good skating ability and a separation gear who creates scoring chances with his quick hands. Uses his size to own the face off circle and dominate opposing centres in many phases with his strong compete level. Strong face-off man and is a good stick-handler able to make neat passes, setting up his linemates. Plays on both the power play and the penalty kill. There are serious questions as to whether he can fill a NHL top six role because he simply hasn’t shown very much scoring prowess. He shows defensive capabilities but I would like him to have a lot more edge and push at his size. The NHL can tolerate a “finesse” big centre IF he is a scorer, but no so much if he isn’t.
