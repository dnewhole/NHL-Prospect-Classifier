German winger blessed with good size and hands. Was relegated to a smaller role and spare part on the powerful Vaxjo Lakers Champions League finalist team.  At times looks like an outstanding developmental prospect who can send the opposition reeling by going to the front and driving through traffic. Has a good hockey IQ and excellent vision. With his high end passing ability teams are viewing him as a really nice late first round option. His soft hands thread the needle with the best of them, when dishing to his linemates with intensity by way of both his forehand and backhand. When he shows inspired play in traffic between the dots, he is moving and shooting with regularity. The issue is the consistency at which he displayed these efforts. Can look disinterested and not willing to get involved for long stretches. Teams look towards the prospects that come to play sixty minutes, even if they may have less skill than many who don't play up to there potential. But teams also hope to change hearts and minds as maturity takes place. For me, this young German lad is a toss-up.
