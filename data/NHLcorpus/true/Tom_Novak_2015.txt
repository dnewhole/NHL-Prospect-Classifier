Highly imaginative centre-wing who excelled in last summer’s Ivan Hlinka tournament. Super smooth stickhandler who can do things at high speed. Yes he can score, but his true value comes from his solid three zone repertoire, his relentless puck pursuit, and instinctive patience and imagination with the biscuit. Creates, dominates and finishes. Smart and fearless whether driving the front or trying to get the puck back. An excellent sauce passer who will set teammates up and he’s gone into the dirty areas and battled for it. Always moving and closing to the puck. He wants the puck in crucial times and the fact that he is a natural sniper doesn’t cause many objections. Has really good vision, and anticipation and can project as a pro winger as easily as a pivot. He displays patience and puck control in tight spaces. It now is a matter of him developing into a pro player, which will take time. He has committed to the University of Minnesota.
