Undersized play-making left winger with excellent skill and hockey smarts. Displays top offensive abilities at the junior level due to his vision and feel for the play and where to be. Elusive one-on-one and an excellent passer. Fearless. Goes to the front. Needs additional core strength, but anyone who tries to dismiss his abilities as an elite stand-alone junior player is not looking at how dominant he can be in so many facets. I don't know how high his NHL ceiling is, but he certainly could be a special player down the road. He already possesses top-notch speed, a separation gear, and elusiveness.
