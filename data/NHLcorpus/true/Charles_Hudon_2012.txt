After exhibiting outstanding instincts and opportunistic strikes in the Ivan Hlinka Tourney, there is reason to believe that this water bug can eventually build himself into a NHLer. He displays tremendous skill, vision and understanding of the game, and is an elite scorer and playmaker. He has nice touch, very quick soft hands and elusive speed to set up in the attack at a moment's notice. A superb finisher who just appears at right time to receive the scoring pass or a tip-in. Takes hits, appears out of nowhere to score. Boom or bust prospect due to the fact he is never going to be a strong defensive stalwartâ€¦or a larger man.
