Another of the tremendous "Dub" crop who is quietly developing into a strong prospect. He brings size, a strong two-way game, and some toughness. He is showing that he has an offensive side from the point or as the jump up guy. A good skater with a bit of speed, but what stands out is how good he is at playing the defensive part of his game.
