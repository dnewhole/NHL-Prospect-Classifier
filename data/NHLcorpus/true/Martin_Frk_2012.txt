Czech winger is just a bit over six feet but plays in juniors like an elite power forward and scorer. He moves well and is a hard worker, always willing to muck down low and play hard in the battle areas. Has a bit of a choppy stride but it doesn't impede his strong propensity to engage and bother the enemy. Displays good vision, great functional strength, a super quick trigger and deadly hard wrist shot. Passes well on both fore & backhand. Learning to play better defensively, he has good set-up and attack skills on the other end. He is physical and plays hard in every game. May lack the skating ability and defensive commitment to be given an opportunity to play in the top six, despite having one of the deadliest cannons in this draft. In preseason, he suffered a concussion that shortened his season considerably, and his ultimate draft rank will depend upon where teams see his long term hockey health, along with his commitment.
