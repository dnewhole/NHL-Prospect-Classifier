This is a player that you definitely draft and hope he develops. He needs plenty of work on lateral pivots and all around footwork, but the guy does have good balance and a nice stride up ice. His hands are not stone. His size gives him plenty of advantage in small passing lanes and on the poke check. You'd like more jam to go with his size. A project that many teams will think about around the middle-late first round.
