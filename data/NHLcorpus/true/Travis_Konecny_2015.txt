Another one of the top end elite skaters and puck movers in the class, with excellent edging, burst and agility. Has the ability to go into tight spaces and control the puck and dictate play. You will see him involved in all three zones, giving strong work ethic in his end and quick bursts to loose pucks or throw checks. His compete level is bigger than his stature so might see him getting bounced a bit along the wall in those puck battles. Simply takes no quarter. The lack of size might be an advantage when he pushes his way through crowds to reach scoring areas, receive passes, and take shots. A player who clearly has a quick release and deceptively strong wrist and snapshots, but is very comfortable distributing the puck and using his smarts to read and react to the defense with slick set-ups. There is much to like about this young man.
