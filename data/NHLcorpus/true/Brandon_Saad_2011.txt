Strong big winger with good hands and vision, who creates space, and has some nasty in his game. He is a competitor who is difficult to handle in front and near the net and displays a quick snapper of a shot in a toolbox that looks to be pro-bound big time. Like so many gifted two way players, he tends to overlook a strong commitment to his defensive zone at times. It remains to be seen if he can embrace this type of role as competition gets tougher.
