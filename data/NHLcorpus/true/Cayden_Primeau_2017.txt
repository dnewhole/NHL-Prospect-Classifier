Yet another impressive, big goaltender with mental toughness, excellent flexibility, good co-ordination and reflexes. Plants himself well. Almost always makes the first stop. Tracks the puck well, and makes many key saves. He can get his pad flat and slide cross crease, staying square to the shooter. Needs work on rebound control and must control his desire to get out too far. Committed to Northeastern University.
