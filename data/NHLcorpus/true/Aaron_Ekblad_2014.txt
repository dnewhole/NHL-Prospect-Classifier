Ekblad is another prospect who has taken a ton of criticism for looking "ordinary." Big defenders seem to always look like they are lumbering (not standing out as a "flash and dash" players,) even while playing solid. Plays big, calm, and poised. Shows physicality, and can dominate, because he is bigger than most opponents. Excellent transition passer,and has a hard point shot. A good balanced skater who has improved his lateral agility, which will help close gaps. With big men, you usually wait for the feet to catch up with the body. When his do, you may see an improving offensive game. It is easy to overlook the lack of wow factor with him when you realize you are getting a huge defender who will play in the bigs. Panic-free big defender with agility, great skating ability, and controlled play. Size, skill, smarts and hockey sense and plays all phases so well. Has a great stick, and is excellent in transition and a fine long passer.Has size, skill, smarts and hockey sense. Plays all phases so well.
