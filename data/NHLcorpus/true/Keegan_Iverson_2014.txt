Big thick potential power winger in the making. Plays a robust take no prisoners style that has him leaving the opposition looking for him and losing track of the play. Far from a proven scorer, he does have the strength, energy, and passion to continue improving his offensive abilities. Does possess a heavy shot and soft hands that get the puck to teammates to provide scoring chances.
