Yet another under six footer with high end speed, excellent vision, touch, and strong work ethic. Despite being a tad undersized he is fearless along the wall and never hesitant to stickhandle in traffic areas or along the wall. Has a superior shot but his elite passing skills are what butters his bread. He is not a passenger; he works hard to take pucks back and on offense. He has a high end understanding of using motion in the attack zone. He finds the creases, and lures defender to him. His quickness and ability to play so strong on the puck opens space for his teammates. Needs to continue getting stronger and further improving his legs to where he has a true separation gear. Uses his speed as a weapon against the opposition breakouts. If he continues his improvement he may end up and NHL top six player maybe even progress to the high expectations many expected him to prior to this season.
