Like his brother who was drafted in the first round last year, he displays a strong offensive game with a strong superb touch in the passing game and a quick wrister. Excellent puck handler, but stays out of battle zones and takes many perimeter shots. Never going to be guy who goes in and battles for the biscuit but he most certainly will fill other needs in an offensive-starved team.
