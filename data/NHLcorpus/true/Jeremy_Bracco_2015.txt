Early on, there have been many comparisons of this youngster to Patrick Kane. I think that is big stretch but I do see skills in him that might warrant the comparison. He is an undersized player with flash, magician-like soft hands and superb stick-handling skills that cause defenders fit in one-on-one situations. Takes full advantage of his light frame and quick feet to blow by defenders. There is much more to the pro game like unearthing pucks and working physically along the boards to gain possession, and handling your man on the backcheck. This is the part of his game that determine where a team selects him. A member of his homelandâ€™s team roster for the World Junior Under-20 at Christmas 2014.
