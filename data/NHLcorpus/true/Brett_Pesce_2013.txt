Tall lanky defenseman with 4-way skating ability and very good offensive tools and hockey sense. A mature all around defender who has offensive upside. Excellent outlet passer, and defensively closes quickly and has an active stick. Distributes the puck well with good vision and patience as the PP pointman. Not shy of contact. Superb at controlling gaps and has an air of calmness to the way he plays his position. He is still not hefty enough to engage many bigger forwards, but he is great at taking the angles on them.
