Calm all-around rearguard whose offensive game will improve. Cannot afford to throw his weight, because he needs to get so much bigger. He understands positioning and reaction in his own defensive zone, and already makes a good first pass, has good all around hockey sense, and potential to grow his up-ice puck carrying game. He moves up and into the play, and can put it on the tape if he's given the puck when he has jumped in. Turns very, very well and has excellent movement laterally and in pivots. He has an active stick and so far in international play displays excellent gap control. Another one of the rising Scadi prospects. In the past, has been a pointman on the PP.
