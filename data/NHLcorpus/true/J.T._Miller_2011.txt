A center-wing who plays a nice puck possession game with grit and bodywork. Some say he may not apply himself consistently to this style and his draft stock will drop if he doesn't become committed 60 minutes. Yet I don't think it is a question of intent as much as he has emptied the tank with his earlier efforts. Punishes on the attack and skates with good balance and jump. He is a good shooter and decent passer and good in his own zone. He is very creative on his carries, and is solid in all zones. Once in transit he can move with the best of them. Although he lacks a first step and doesn't consistently play strong on the puck when in the attack, he will be given time to add to his offensive game, since the payout may be a big reward to the team that selects him.  Exceeds tags labeling him a checking line role player.
