An undersized winger who can make it rain on the power play. Shifty and opportunistic and strong on his skates. Slips away and finds the soft spot and wants the puck. Exceptional athlete who despite an undersized frame will not be taken off the puck. Although he may not project as high as a second line contributor, he has been his team’s key PP player, because he set up teammates with cross-ice feeds as well as having one terrific shot. Don’t make the mistake of thinking he can’t beat you from many areas with his deadly shot and exceptional set-ups, because he will. The questions will come as what exactly is his high-water mark.
