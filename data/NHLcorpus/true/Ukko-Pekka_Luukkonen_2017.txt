Big Finnish goalie who plays with quickness, mobility, recovery speed, and post-to-post agility. He had the luxury of playing in front of an awfully good HPK team that limits his shot totals to in the low twenties. His size leaves little open space between the goal-opening. Plays with composure and is good at handling the puck. Vey competitive and strong down low.
