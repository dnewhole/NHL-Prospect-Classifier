Physical forward whose two brothers, Tye and Jamie have already been drafted. Missed almost seven weeks with a broken wrist. Not the biggest guy, but plays big. A very good skater with quickness, gears, and lateral agility that make him a noticed forechecker and player that puts pressure on the defense. Has a good shot.
