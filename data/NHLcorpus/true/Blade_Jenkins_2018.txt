Big centre-forward from the USA developmental program with a high skill set. Displays good vision and can go around defenders turning the corner to the slot area. Probably is more suited as a winger, utilizing his quickness and strength. Has shown some jam down low in the scoring areas but needs to be more competitive and aggressively get pucks on the forecheck. Looks like a future left wing as he progresses and adds intensity and defensive awareness.
