Good all around centre who plays at a high tempo with creativity. Good decision maker and playmaker with excellent stick-handling ability. Moves well laterally, and has plenty of juice to spin, shoot, or pass when he sees an attack opening. Not a scorer, but is good at getting the puck to the scorers he plays alongside.
