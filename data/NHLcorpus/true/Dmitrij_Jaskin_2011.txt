Large, physical power wing type with a nice hard wrist shot, good vision and decent hands.  Big and strong on the puck in battle areas, but his skating needs to improve. He is deceptively quick North-South on the blades though. Was out seven weeks with a knee injury. Has many desirable parts but needs improvement to become the sum of those parts.
