Big framed goaler with patience, good reads, and positioning. Moves well side to side with solid footwork, staying square to oncoming shooters. Doesn't give the opposition much to shoot at. He stays big and then can use his size and legs to take away all the lower part of the net. Needs work on his rebound control and tracking the puck better. At this point is not the greatest athletic goalie. Improving his reaction time would help, and his puck-handling. Has patience and the team that drafts him will need some too.
