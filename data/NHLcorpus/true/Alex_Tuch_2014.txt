Big wing who is good on his edges and gets to the net. Offensively has a good skill set, with hands that let go a quick hard shot. Can power to the front and is stong on his carries, using his reach to control the biscuit. Needs to get a bit quicker, and is still raw and needs further development. Certainly a lot to like as he keeps  getting better.
