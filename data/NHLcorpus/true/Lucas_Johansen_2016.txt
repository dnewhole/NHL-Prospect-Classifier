Emerging defender who projects as a two way defender with strong balance and skating ability. The younger brother of Ryan is still a work in progress, but has size and is a very good puck mover and plays on both the penalty kill and the power play. Leads by example and can move attacker out of the front,  get in the lanes and break up passes, and he make that first pass out in transition and jump into the rush. Displays a very good point shot. Will play the body, but if he added a bit more aggression, he make it more difficult to play against him. Needs to get thicker and add weight and muscle.
