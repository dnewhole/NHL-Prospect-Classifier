Smart positional strong centre with a high compete level and willingness to throw his body around.Son of Niklas who scored a half a point a game as an NHL pro, he also displays strong offensive skills. High hockey IQ who knows where everybody is and where things are going. A complete player in all phases and zones who leads by example. Stands up for his teammates. Never stops working in the attack zone and more importantly in the defensive zone. Has a hitch in his stride as he is a short choppy strider, but it in no way deters his advancement to the higher levels of play. And edgy centre who seems to be able to quickly adjust to new linemates and making the better. His stint in the Four Nations tourney in November playing alongside RW Carl Grundstr√∂m (Toronto draft pick).and LW Elias  Pettersson saw them dominate. He scored a couple in the World Junior U-20 also.
