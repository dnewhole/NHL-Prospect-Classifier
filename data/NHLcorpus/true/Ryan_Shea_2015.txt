Average build defenseman with good vision and offensive savvy. Possesses terrific four-way mobility and has great tools to continue to hone his defensive side. Has strong footwork and lateral movement that signals continued improvement in his gap control. He is difficult to beat one on one. Handles the puck well and loves to activate through his own rushes and passes to become the fourth attacker. Long term project with good upside. He has committed to Northeastern University.
