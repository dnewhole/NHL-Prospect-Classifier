Plays on a veteran club and, on many a night, is the best player on that club and even carrying it. Skinny, smooth skater who has soft hands, good vision, and good touch. He has good speed once he is moving but doesn't seem to have high end starting gear. He is good in the attack whether he has the puck or not. He reads the ice and passes the puck well. He is always in there after loose pucks. Has seen more action at wing then center, which in my opinion, he is better suited to play. That should not be a deterrent, as it just makes him more versatile. He needs more commitment to the defensive side, but has a knack in the defensive zone to get things ironed out and gets back going the other way on offense.
