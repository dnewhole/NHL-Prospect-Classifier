Plays an extremely mature two-way game, but you can't leave without feeling he has top-level offensive abilities, due to his skating, elite skill, and puck-moving strengths. Already pretty sound defensively and has a big cannon on the PP right point with his left hand shot. Confident and smooth, he can lead the rush, or quickly close down and stop the ememy's attempt at one. At this point not overly large, but gets the job done. Controls gaps and will step up physically to stop the advance. Clearly one of the top  defenders in North America, but will need polish to advance. He was selected to the roster for the World Junior Under-18 Tournament in April.
