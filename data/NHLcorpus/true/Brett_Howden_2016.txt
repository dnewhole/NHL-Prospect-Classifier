Big strong centre-left wing who sets up shop in front and feeds of deflections and rebounds. Not a flashy player, just an load to move who plays all 200 feet. He has gradually improved his defensive zone work, and his overall game. Smart player who skates well with good balance. Has a strong and effective shot, and works the give and go very effectively. Is strong on the puck, and uses his reach and size to win puck battles in the greasy areas. He sees the ice well.
