Son of former NHLer Ted, and a solid three zone player who works hard each shift. He might be considered an underrated player based on the fact he doesn’t have high end separation skills or that explosive burst that teams look for. He combines his hustling fearless demeanor with good vision and off the charts hands, displaying what might be top ten hand-eye co-ordination in the class.  Exploits defenses using his instincts and in most games it’s difficult to find another player on the sheet with as much heart and intensity.
