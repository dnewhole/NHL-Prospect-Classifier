The big center was going to be counted on for his defensive prowess and size, but has shown surprising offensive abilities early on in his rookie campaign with the "Q." He needs work in the face-off circle, with his footwork and sustainin physicality, but his scoring ability and the projected potential in all other areas has to get him first round consideration early on. He was selected to the roster for the World Junior Under-18 Tournament in April. He has been one of the big surprises in the QMJHL. The questions NHL teams will ask is he really a second line big centre who will play big, and pot some goals.
