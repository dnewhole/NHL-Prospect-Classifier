Displays excellent skill set, good size and giddy-up. Wins puck battles and is responsible in his own end. Has a strong two-way game. Moves well with deceptive quickness. Has been stuck on Flint with no help for two seasons. If the World Juniors Under-18 showed us anything, it was that he quickly meshed with different line-mates and outworked the opposition night after night. Grinds away whether it be keeping pucks alive on the offense or with dogged forechecking to turn the puck over.  Excellent vision and playmaking ability. A developing player who makes it easy for his wingers and is still blossoming as a scorer.
