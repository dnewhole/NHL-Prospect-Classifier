They donâ€™t come much bigger than this promising winger who displays a lot more than size.  Has vey quick feet for such a large man, and shows power in his stride. Emerging puck skills and good feet, coupled with his strong wall presence make him a strong candidate for selection in the first round if he continues to improve. Since he was 15, he was bigger, better and stronger than his competition. His gifts may start there, but the skill and soft hands are what put him on the upward spiral.
