Once thought of as undersized and injury-prone, he started flying out of the ashes from the CHL prospects game and had a 30 goal and 59 point season, without the luxury of a high edn centreman to feed him the puck.  Relentless in puck pursuit, very similar to his father, Cliff, a former NHLer. A quick agile skater who attacks the goalie with patience and cuts and weaves fearlessly  in the attack zone, eventually having the goaltender commit and for him to capitalize. Can take a hit and make the play. Projects as a small fourth line NHLer with hustle and jump.
