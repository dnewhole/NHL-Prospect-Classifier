Pure goal scoring speedster who is work in progress. He has size very good size, and girth, and besides the great speed, he can be a threat from anywhere inside the attack zone. Displays both a strong slapper and wrist shot. Will release the puck from what seems like low percentage angles and find the back of the net. Might have gained too much muscle and weight with the 18 pounds he added...it has reduced his pure foot speed a bit, but it does help in his puck possession battles. Needs to read the situations and hit the mark with his shots, not just let fly with reckless abandon. Terrific PP cannon, but he still needs to develop his on ice reads away from shoot, shoot and shoot and also survey his options. Could develop more defensive commitment and work away from the puck.
