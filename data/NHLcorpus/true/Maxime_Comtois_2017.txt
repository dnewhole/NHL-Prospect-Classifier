The Ch√¢teauguay Grenadiers graduate is the surprise door prize that will fall to a team not picking first but in the high pick area. Scouts will be be able to cite what he doesn't have, but he has a long list of strengths that translate to the pro game that are already blossoming. He is an absolute force and can line up anywhere in the forward position and dominate with intimidating big league hits. Plays heavy and punishes. Very on-ice smart and has terrific straight line speed. His speed can make him elusive in his carries, but his size also allows him to bull his way to chances, as he sees the ice well. Handles the puck at a high pace and has a great one-timer. Can move at his top end speed and handle the puck with quick hands and also has a hard wrist snapper. Good hands and good on the cycle, he is a two way player with little risk, because he plays for you as a dominant wing, and may just be a high end all around performer.
