Excellent long term defensive prospect with a long frame, light skates, and puck moving skills. Not fancy, makes that first pass, and is poised and confident in his own end. Had upside as a PP guy, with a developing strong point shot and strong wrister. Rangy two-way defender who can carry and move the puck up ice and also provide some mustard and jam as a defender. An effortless skater with great mobility acceleration and elusiveness. Reads the sheet and passes extremely well. Can let loose an excellent shot on the move, put it on the tape, or skate it it in. His natural balance and feet let him close well and body check with power. Was named to the USA Developmental team playing in the Ivan Hlinka Tournament. A developing prospect who is rising up the boards. He is committed to the University of Wisconsin.
