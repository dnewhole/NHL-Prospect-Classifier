Almost six foot winger who is creative on the offense, despite not being a quick strike attacker. Has really excellent hands and makes plays with his stick and movement, while reading the ice for the best option. Smooth stick handler who makes whomever are his linemates a tad better without a need for adjustment time. Plays at top speed  and loves to attack and provide scoring chances for teammates. Committed to Boston College.
