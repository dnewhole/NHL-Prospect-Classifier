Swiss defender with all around the rink smarts. Diagnoses the situation and reacts accordingly. Good puck carrier who can go up ice quickly or slow the game down. Closes down on attackers and is a good hitter. Turns quickly and is very good with the  transition pass up ice. Just starting to scratch the surface of his potential. Player rising on the radar. He displays strong glimpses of all the things you desire in an NHL defenseman. You may not look at him as a top pairing guy, just an NHL defenseman who fits and plays and improves.He was selected to the roster for the World Junior Under-18 Tournament in April. A member of his homelandâ€™s team roster for the World Junior Under-20 at Christmas 2014.
