Big, mobile defenseman who is a bit of a long-term project, but displays an emerging physically punishing game. An exceptional PK defender with quick starts/stops and a quick stick. Father played pro football. Donavan McNabb is married to his aunt. Very fluid skater with fine range, and displays playmaking abilities. Still needs to build his defensive game and edge. Reads situations well and can pass the puck tape to tape. Can throw punishing hits and use his reach. At this juncture, he plays it safe, and doesn't go out of his way to jump into the attack. There is excellent upside because he shows strong instincts in all three zones, has a good stick, and can dish while his wheels are churning. His improved up-ice work as puck carrier and passer has elevated him as a first rounder, and there is still time for him to build his offensive game. I don't think that aspect will drop him very far down the NHL team lists.
