Excellent skating big winger who handles the biscuit well while in flight and has some creativity in the offensive zone. His draft status is hampered by the fact he plays for a weaker team in the “Q.” Plays strong for sixty minutes but is in need of a quality centreman to compliment his game. A creative offensive mind who puts pucks to the correct areas and right players even though they fail to visualize the attack as well as he does. Displays a hard quick shot.
