Slippery centre-forward who is patient and disciplined when in control of the puck. Displays excellent feet and bursts. can stop/start very quickly and his agility and separation skills and agility can cause fits in defenders. Makes plays by drawing in defenders, going laterally, then times perfect passes to his wingers that were able to jump free while he held on. Always keeps feet going when he doesn’t have the puck, and gets loose from his checks in scoring areas. Seems like more of a scorer than a strong set-up man. Needs to get a stronger presence on the wall and stay involved when he doesn’t have the puck on his stick. Has committed to the University of Minnesota.
