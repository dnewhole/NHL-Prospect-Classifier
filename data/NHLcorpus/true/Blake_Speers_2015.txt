Intriguing developmental forward who plays with a short stick and still manages great control of the biscuit and superb accuracy to his shots. Dangerous on the due to his elite speed. Lets go strong snap shots, using defensemen as his screens. Needs to increase his work ethic and stay fully involved and be less of a passenger. Needs to work hard to get open, and get involved more in both zones.Needs to br bigger and stronger.
