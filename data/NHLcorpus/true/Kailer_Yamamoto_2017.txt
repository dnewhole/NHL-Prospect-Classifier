Another small guy who seems to instantly make any linemates better due to his fabulous playmaking ability and smarts. Will stick his nose and contribute mightily in all three zones. A terrific skater with lateral mobility and explosiveness. Displays excellent vision and competitiveness. Darts into the open areas or flies into the battle areas snatching loose pucks and capitalizing. Equally dangerous as a scorer or set up man. His connection to the NHL is fellow Washington State native Tyler Johnson's mother, who taught him how to skate.
