His Bantam and Midget resume tell of a consistent scorer/generator with a strong physical game. So far he has been asked to be an all situation player with the Giants, and hasnâ€™t disappointed. Big bodied left wing with physicality and edginess. Displays a strong defensive game, hockey IQ, a nice skill set, and does all things at an above average levels.  And although he has a choppy stride, he is powerful and coupled with his high-end stickhandling skills and size, he fearless competes down low and in all the battle areas. Good on the cycle. An excellent passer and his precise shot and release are also high-end, although his assist totals surpass his goals. Usually the unprecise art of scout attempts to look at the entire canvass starting with the early age years and the question is asked is the prospects continuing to improve on his scoring, abilities and can he be projected as a player who will continue in improving ensuring a role on an NHL club whether it be top six or bottom six. The point is to project that you are drafting a player who eventually makes your parent club. I think that if his goal totals were a bit higher, there would be no questions that he makes the grade. I think his goal totals with continue upward and his development is far from over.
