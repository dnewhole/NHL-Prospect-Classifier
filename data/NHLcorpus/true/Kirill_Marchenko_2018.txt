Tall lanky Russian winger with good feet, balance, and stride. Nice lateral agility and quick hands in his carries. Sees the ice well, and is good at putting hard passes on his teammates sticks.  A close area battler for possessions, he is a longer term project who needs more work, but shows promise in all areas.
