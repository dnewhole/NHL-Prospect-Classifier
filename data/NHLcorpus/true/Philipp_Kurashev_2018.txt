Smart slick puck-handling centre with decent speed and East-West lateral agility. High hockey IQ and creative instincts as a passer. Sees and anticipates developing plays. Far from ready to be considered NHL worthy, as he has zero interest in getting dirty in physical games. But you cannot argue that he isn't a fine playmaker despite his lack of any grittiness or edge at this juncture.  Needs plenty of work in the face-off circle, but I can see him as winger in his present playing style.
