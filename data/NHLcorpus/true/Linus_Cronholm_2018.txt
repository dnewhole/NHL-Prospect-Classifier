Big, raw, defensively solid, edgy defender who has seems to have gotten lost in the pile of high-end Swedish defensemen. Makes a hard first pass out of his end. No flash, just a really strong on his skates player who is really solid in his own end. Blocks shots, clears the front, and plays the body with regularity and some snarl. Is starting to show progress as an offensive zone player displaying a cannon from the back end. Has shown more confidence in jumping up in the play. Is more than willing to be a total team guy and stand up for his teammates. A sleeper who might surprise.
