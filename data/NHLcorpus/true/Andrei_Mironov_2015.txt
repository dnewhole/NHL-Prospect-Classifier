Solid two-way contributor to the Russian National Junior team in both the Subway Super Series and the World Junior Tourney. Positionally sound, plays with an edge that makes him a perfect candidate for import from across the pond, and ready to plug-n-play, except for the fact that he is still under contract in the KHL, which might see him going undrafted. Defensive minded, and has a strong tough in your face style, and will try to force his will on the enemy. Solid decision-maker who keeps his composure and also has an up-ice attack game.
