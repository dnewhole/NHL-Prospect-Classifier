Diminutive centre with keen offensive instincts at feet that are always moving. Fast enough that he eludes checks and seems to dart out from nowhere to receive passes and get scoring chances. He couples that elusiveness with tremendous stick-handling ability and great touch down low. Hard-working smaller player with excellent jump and ability to pressure. Relentless in pursuit and responsible in his own end. Generates offense with his passes and steals.
