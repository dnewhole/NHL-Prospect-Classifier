Dominant player with outstanding vision and natural scoring ability. He still needs to get stronger, but already displays elite scoring instincts. Big time shot that comes in hard and heavy. Great feet and balance and moves effortlessly to open space and in traffic always diagnosing the best place to go with the biscuit. He is more of a straight-line skater and that might hamper mega-success as a pro centre. Though not really big, he is fearless and physical in his desire to set up scoring opportunities. Aggressive player who is a natural scorer and a pretty good set-up man. Saw time on RW in Subway Series and may end up playing there in the World Juniors. Has scored five goals in game. I don't mean to disrespect a truly great young player, who in most years, would hands down be in consideration for the top selection, but the question remains: if a team feels he just doesn't seem to have that inert feel for setting up the attack and more like he is that scorer who can be a weapon from the wing, teams may look elsewhere if they want a true centreman. Combines high hockey IQ with a strong skating base, toughness, puck skills, and quick-counter abilities to out-match most opponents.
