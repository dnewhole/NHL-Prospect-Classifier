Arguably the best prospect in the Czech Extraleague, showing excellent offensive instincts and playmaking abilities. He makes up for lack of breakaway speed by being a balanced skater who plays strong on the puck and goes fearlessly into all attack areas getting him separation. Reads situations well and his decision-making skills are well above-average. Solid forecheck who usually finishes. He dangles really well, has great hands, and a great back-hand which he used to tie the USA in World Juniors in the middle period. He displays soft mitts and passes the puck really well in the offensive zone. Needs work defensively but is committed to improvement all around.
