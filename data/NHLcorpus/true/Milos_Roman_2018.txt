Speedy centre-forward with a terrific first step, good stick, and puck handling prowess. It is difficult to move him off the puck when he is working down low. A dynamic tracking force on offense and aggressive forechecker who unearths pucks. Was slowed by ankle injury he incurred at the World Junior U-20. His downside is he isn’t interested in hard battles for pucks on the wall or traffic. He isn’t timid, just leery.
