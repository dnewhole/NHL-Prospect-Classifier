Thick, strong high schooler who dominates the entire ice. Moves quickly and efficiently into the attack zone and tilts the ice with continual carries that create advantageous looks for his team. Seems to be far superior to his present teammates, and it lessens his dominance. If his hockey IQ reads openings on the ice and linemates don't see what he does, they are less likely to be in advantageous.  This makes him seem less effective, but his high skills are less evident. You are selecting him and waiting as he develops. Committed to University of Minnesota.
