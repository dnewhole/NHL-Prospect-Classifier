Undersized “push” defenseman with a solid understanding in the defensive zone. This is a player who is woefully underdeveloped physically, and one who will need time to become naturally accustomed to playing his position without hesitation or thinking. His skating and passing ability is high-end; excellent passer who easily QBs the attack from the top. Plays hard on the puck with his carries in, and has a terrific touch with his set-ups. Can pass while in a backward stride and displays a precise wrist shot from the point. Needs more development to get stronger and add the muscle to aid him in front and when in contact situations with attacking players in his end. He has committed to Denver University where he will be tutored at his position as he does grow stronger.
