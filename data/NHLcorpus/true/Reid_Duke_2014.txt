Has shown potential to be a top pick by way of his elusive skating and puck-handling and above average speed. Has some grit is strong on the puck and very good one on one. The problem is he is inconsistent shift to shift and needs to be a 60 minute player. Maybe further weight training and strength will build his game in this area.
