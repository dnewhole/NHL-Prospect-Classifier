One of the youngest players in the class. Might be the best puck distributor in the class of defenseman. Coupled with his nice long skating stride and great edging, he can gain separation with stops and starts, but alway thinking far ahead with where he is making a play with the puck. His great passing gets him out of trouble in his own end. Sees a lane open and gets the puck to his man.
