Meat and potatoes winger whose game involves strong physical combat with opposing players, and solid forecheck, strong work ethic, a deceptively hard accurate shot, and quick feet. Strong in puck pursuit and strong on the forecheck. Actully has pretty soft hands. Maybe the difference in selecting a player with high end upside and Katchouk, is he is going already be suited for growing in to a role as a checking winger as he climbs the ladder to higher levels of play. Disruptive and aggressive in keeping possession, there is no question that he has skills, nose for the net, skating ability, edge and the willingness to be an involved player for sixty minutes. And that might count for more than higher end abilities and no taste for the playing for and against “heavy game” players. Has dual Canadian and Russian citizenship.
