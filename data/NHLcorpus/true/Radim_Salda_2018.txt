Thin mobile defender with good size and skill. Second year eligible. Smart with his carries and puck movement. Strong power play point shot. Pinches in well in the attack zone, and battles hard for puck possession on the wall. His attack skills are rapidly progressing. Good skater but isnâ€™t accomplished at taking his skating ability and using it to improve his play. He will stop moving his feet when taking on rushing defenders. He will drift out of position in his own zone when the opposition has possession, and seems easily manhandled in front of his own net.
