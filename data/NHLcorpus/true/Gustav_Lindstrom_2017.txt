An aggressive, 2-way defenseman with great passing and scoring instincts. Most notable for his 4-goal, 5-assist performance in a single game for Almunta in U16s. Since then, he's continued to put up great offensive numbers, including 7 points in 4 games for his country internationally. He struggled a little in his first season with Sweden's second-tier league (Allsvenskan), particularly in his play without the puck and defending larger forwards. He still managed to finish 2nd in scoring among U19 defenders. There's skill here, but he needs time to develop his puck handling and fill out his frame.
