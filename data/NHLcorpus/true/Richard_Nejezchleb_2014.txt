So far has been passed on in two draft years, due to the fact that he had the tools, but the toolbox was considered empty. Has the size, but is lacking a first step and his stride is short. He is not balanced or agile. Once moving he can create separation against defenders and passes the puck well in traffic. Good wall game. The transfer from the Czech Republic to the Wheatkings  did show a more physical side emerge. Regardless of his negatives, he has a strong quick stick and good hands, but needs consistency along with better skating technique.
