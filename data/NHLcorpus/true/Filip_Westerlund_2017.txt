Undersized blue liner who displays a high confidence level in his carries and accurate passing ability. Terrific, well-balanced skater who can hurdle out of his end in breakouts, with excellent hands and hockey IQ. May be accused of trying to do to much solo. He needs the benefit of more time to develop both game wise and physically, as he still can be a detriment in corner play and in front.
