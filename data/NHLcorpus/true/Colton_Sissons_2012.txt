Kelowna's Captain has high hockey IQ, and a great three-zone game. Relentless in puck pursuit, he is more of a wing who can project up and down the lines due to his high-energy play, slick passes, and big-time shot. Presently a first line player in Kelowna as a center. He has a big time shot, good speed, an aggressive game, and plenty of character.
