He is never going to be recognized as a puck carrying dee-man, he nonetheless does have a good shot and some up-ice ability. He is better off when he sticks to the things he excels in, like being the large mobile defender who gets to the attackers and takes them out with aggression, big hits, and downright challenges. Unafraid to knock on the door of the other team's toughest guy and ask him to come out and play. Has decent range of his skates, good balance and a nice reach to break things up. Big defenseman who plays a solid defensive game by keeping it simple. Uses his size and clears the front. Can be pressured into mistakes when rushed, and is working to improve his puck handling ability.  Was named to the USA Developmental team playing in the Ivan Hlinka Tournament.
