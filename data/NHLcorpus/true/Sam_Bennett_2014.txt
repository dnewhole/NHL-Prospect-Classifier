A centre-wing with great foot speed, skills and edge. Can score and generate offense, but also forecheck with opposing players shaken when he is coming. In open ice, his acceleration gives him even more respect and he is an excellent one-on-one attacker. He will get stronger and maybe bigger. His compete style and versatility have him on the board as a possible first overall. He was selected to the roster for the World Junior Under-18 Tournament in April, 2013.
