Has been on the radar for several seasons as his skill level has always been evident. He was selected to the roster for the World Junior Under-18 Tournament in April. A dynamic player who despite his smaller size, is an impact player capable of getting dirty and competing against all comers. Displays great vision, IQ and feel for the attack. A flyer with first step quickness, who plays strong on the puck, and excellent puck-handling skills and lateral mobility. Will need to get even stronger but he has deceptive array of shots, and excellent set-up skills, and goes to the battle areas with reluctance at his present size and strength. A very creative offensive generator who can find a teammate or bring the fans out of their seats with his sudden offensive forays. The question might be can he stay focused and give 100% effort for sixty minutes. Again being a elite player in Czech, he hasn't developed the strong defensive commitment he will need in the North American game. It just isn't there yet. A member of his homelandâ€™s team roster for the World Junior Under-20 at Christmas 2014.
