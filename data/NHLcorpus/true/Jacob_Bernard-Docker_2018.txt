Solid defense prospect who does the little things that lead to success, without flash and dash, or an advanced offensive game.  An excellent head that goes hand in hand with excellent feet. A strong short area burst that will slip him by the initial line of defense. Catches the opposition napping with his quick cuts and knows how to effectively slow play down. Really high IQ and effectiveness in his decisions. Has a nice low shot he gets off with some mustard. Is really advanced with his gap control, angling off and mirroring of opponents in the course of their attacks. Makes solid transition passes and looks to have high-end upside as he progresses through the college ranks. Committed to the University of Notre Dame.
