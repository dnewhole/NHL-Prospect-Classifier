Clearly one of the top end elite skaters and puck movers in the class. Has the ability to play in tight space and control the puck and play. Plays like he knows he has more ability than the rest of the ice, and is poised and composed in all phases when he gets a puck in his end. He is able to work out with smart passes or carry the mail with top acceleration. Good in his one end, and although not overly big framed, he have the stamina to fight through the rough going and excel. A member of his homelandâ€™s team roster for the World Junior Under-20 at Christmas 2014.
