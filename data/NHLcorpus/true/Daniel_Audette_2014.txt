His bloodlines and elusiveness put the undersized Audette on scout's radar because of his skill,speed and heart. His skating base, and lower body strength make him strong on the puck and a guy who plays big and is a scoring threat at a moment's notice. Reads the ice and can handle the puck at his top gear, but also he can go laterally with sharp cuts and stop/starts to get loose. His vision allows him to slip away and act on the room he has made for himself, as he passes the puck extremely well and also works hard in his own end back checking. Looks like a good long term selection who may help a team down the road.
