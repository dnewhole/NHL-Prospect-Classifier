Nice puck moving defenseman with four way skating ability, good vision, foot speed, and agility. QBs the PP with good puck distribution, and no hesitation in attempts to activate into the slot when the attack calls. Can make the outlet pass well. Still has a ways to go in honing his defensive side, but long term there is a foundation to build on.
