Poised puck hander with good vision, hockey sense, and offensive instincts. A strong transition player who has excellent four direction mobility and elite straight ahead acceleration. Displays good composure and is solid in his end at the junior level and stays home until he is sure he can join in on the attack. His feet aid not only his gap control, but let him burst in and disrupt their entrances. Gets his stick out and breaks up the passing lanes in opposition attacks. He is a good outlet passer in transition, able to get out of tight spaces and can jump up and join the attack and tear through the opposition neutral zone positioning. Terrific one timer, and a no-look pass/shot that is never telegraphed. Excellent touch passer and he can barrel across the blue line, fake a shot, and glide in closer for an even better one. Can get caught down low when he activates, but I canâ€™t think of any NHL club that will have concerns about his size or long range upside.
