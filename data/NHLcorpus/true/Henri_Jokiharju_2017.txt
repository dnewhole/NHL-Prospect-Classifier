Not big or thick, but prototypical in style to the new age defenseman who has good feet, stick, and high skill in playing the game at the fastest pace. Not a punishing physical defender, but one who wins races to the puck, anticipate plays, legally tie attackers up, and always has his stick and body positioned on the right side of the puck carrier. Blessed with great balance and quick feet, he is superb puck mover who advances the biscuit with sharpness and accuracy. Smart with or without the puck, he makes quick decisions and always places it, in the correct spot at the right time when advancing it. Makes the long stretch pass out of the zone and on the power play, he shows great vision in his puck distribution.
