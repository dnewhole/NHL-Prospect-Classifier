Two way wing with good size and instinctive scoring prowess. Not really gifted as a balanced or quick skater, he plods back and forth with little acceleration or quickness. That being said, skating can be improved. His gift is incredible hand/eye coordination that is used by him gaining position inside the circles and him delivering goals on deflections, rebounds and passes. Can pick an area of the net and quickly releases acquired pucks to the back of the netting. Will work the wall and use his size. He was selected to the roster for the World Junior Under-18 Tournament in April.
