Tall, slender Swedish RW/LW with good hands and presence in the crease area. May be top end offensive skill. Has a burst to beat defenders outside, has ability to get open in the attack, and quickly releases his shot. Very agile and can play to the speed of his feet. Soft hands and shot, but sometimes hogs the puck because of his faith in his own ability to score and doesn't distribute when he probably should. Excellent one-timer and instinctive offensive abilities. Although not overly physical, plays in the dirty areas and withstands the pounding. Protects the puck well, and willing to get dirty to keep it. Could be an explosive pro wing, whose acceleration makes him a threat with each touch of the puck.He was selected to the roster for the World Junior Under-18 Tournament in April.
