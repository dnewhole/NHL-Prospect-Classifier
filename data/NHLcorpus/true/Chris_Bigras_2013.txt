Smart six foot offenseman who is able to lead, QB and dominate on his team's PP. He doesn't make many mistakes, playing his position very disciplined. A solid all around defender in junior. He has excellent upside as a prospect due to his hockey IQ, and smart decision making, but I just don't see him as first rounder or player NHL teams select with their first choice, as he is a 'tweener" and past history has seen guys close in comparison be devalued because teams are weary as to whether they can grow and develop into the pro game. He was selected to the roster for the World Junior Under-18 Tournament in April.
