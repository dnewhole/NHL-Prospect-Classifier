Warrior with good speed, decent size, and fearlessness in battle areas. Positions himself well when his team is without the puck. Strong on his skates and very mobile. Excellent face-off man with a strong quick release on his shot. Throws the opposition off with his tenacity and infectious edge. Hockey sense plus scoring ability and relentless two-way commitment. A center who distributes the puck exceptionally well and shoots it well. Very strong and has good upside to grow an offensive game. Strong on his skates and a good diagnostician while moving with speed on the attack. He added quickness to his stride but can get quicker. He was selected to the roster for the World Junior Under-18 Tournament in April, and was arguably the best player in the US win in the semis. (Committed to the University of Michigan)
