Big body whose size at this juncture can work against him when he is not moving his feet or read the ensuing attack. Capable of nice plays with his D to D passes, but his vision and hockey IQ still is not where it should be. Combine that with feet that are slow to adjust to the change in attack and looks that make him become uncomfortable and prone to turnovers. Uses his size along the wall and is a good character kid. He is a developmental prospect who needs to work on his turns, agility, and improving in all phases, but does project as an interesting prospect long term.
