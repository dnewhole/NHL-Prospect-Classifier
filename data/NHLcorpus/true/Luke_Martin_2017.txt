Thick, stay at home defender who is now a Freshman at the University of Michigan. Has shown an uptick in his agility and footwork, but continues to be a player who has to work a bit of physicality into every match he plays. If he can, he will body attackers off the puck in this area. Is steady in his own end and makes a crisp breakout pass in transition. Handles the opposition forecheck pretty well. He hasn't displayed much offensive creativity, but like so many players in this class, they are going to need developmental time and could make leaps in improvement.
