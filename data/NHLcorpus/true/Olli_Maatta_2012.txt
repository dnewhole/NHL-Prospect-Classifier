The concussion he suffered early in the World Junior Tournament has certainly placed a cloud around his slotting. After acting as the leader of the Finn Junior team in the August Ivan Hlnka Tourney, he made his way across the pond to the OHL's London Knights. He is an all-around defenseman that brings toughness and physicality in the defensive zone but rarely misses a chance in transition to rush up ice. One of the younger players in the draft, he is a powerful skater who makes the right decisions wherever he is and no matter how pressured he might be. His biggest strength is the consistency of his play, game in and game out. Displays good speed, vision, and stamina and plays hard no matter how much time is on the clock. He passes the puck with excellent accuracy, and has a heavy point shot. He battles and engages the opposition whenever he can, and is well versed at keeping the puck in the attack zone.  Heavy Point shot.  Although he is average in his first two steps, and less offensive-minded than many of the other D-men in this draft. He may get overlooked early, but he looks to be a fine long term prospect with significant upside, and showed as much in the Under-18 World Tourney in May.
