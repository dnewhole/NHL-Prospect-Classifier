Wispy thin centre-ing who has great speed, creativity, and competitiveness. Despite his clear need of bulk and muscle, he already contributes strong wall work and fearlessness in the greasy areas. He has shown a strong two way game and feet that add to the high pace nature of his on ice game. A  long term developmental forward who needs time.
