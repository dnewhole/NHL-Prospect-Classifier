Was named to the U.S. World Junior A roster for the Junior A Challenge. Third year eligible who isnâ€™t big, but definitely has grown his game. Excellent lateral mobility, quickness ability to creat chances as he forces takeovers with good forechecking and banging. Creative and shifty. Some team may take a chance.
