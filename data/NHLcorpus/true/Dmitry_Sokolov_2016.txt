Has gone from a tiny high skilled forward to a solidly built one who can dominate with high end skill. Doesnâ€™t possess high end jump but sees and reads the on ice situations to his advantage.Tends to over-carry the puck instead of advancing it to better scoring options. Very strong and solid with significant upside to project as a top nine player, if he could get more interest in being a factor when he doesn't have the puck. To this point, he seems like a player who oozes with upside, but has done very very little to apply his strengths in the team game.
