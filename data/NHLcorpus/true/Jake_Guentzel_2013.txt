Diminutive centre who has a high hockey IQ and feel for the play.  Has always managed to be an offensive threat at each level, due to his tremendous laterally quickness, and edging. Strong snap shot that he lets go at a moment's notice. Strong forechecker who drives possession. Displays good defensive committment. Must get stronger but will probably merit consideration due to his scoring ability.
