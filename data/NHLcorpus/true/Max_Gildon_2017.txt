Big defender with a heavy one-timer, which acts a large part of his teamâ€™s power play. Is very agile and a four direction skater with good balance for a big man. A developmental work in progress and needs work on his defensive-zone coverage, positioning, and to get that big cannon to hit the net. Is progressing as an active puck carrier who was able to move down low with his touches.
