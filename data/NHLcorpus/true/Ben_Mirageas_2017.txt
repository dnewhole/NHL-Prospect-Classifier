A long term project that struggled at times this season, but has the size and mobility that might develop over time. He can make the quick outlets in transition, and hustles back into his end to retrieve pucks. At times seems to be lack in vision and overall hockey sense, especially when he feels the pressure closing down on him. Committed to Providence College.
