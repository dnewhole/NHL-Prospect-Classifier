A "veteran" from the Czech U-20 league, who transplanted in the OHL with Kitchener. He is a versatile two-way player who is excellent with the puck as well as when going after it. Has above good straight line speed, passing and finishing skills. Despite some balance issues, he is strong on the puck, and a willing wall worker, who is good in traffic. A character player with good instincts, drive to the end, and willingness to work the wall. As with many youngsters, he needs to get stronger and improve his lateral skating and agility. He already shows good defensive zone commitment and is closer to NHL duty than most other forwards that will get selected in the first round.
