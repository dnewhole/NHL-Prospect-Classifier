The Jamacian-Canadian is an all-compass skater with gliding edges who has an advanced skill-set and great jump. Get defenders on their heel as he darts to the open spaces, to the puck carrier, and to shoot the puck. Still a lightweight in need of functional strength, he nonetheless is a threat most times the puck is on his stick. Shoots the puck extremely well. Has soft hands and handles the puck at top speed, and seems to get the jump on defenders and weave his way laterally around them with relative ease. Has an excellent release and an offensive mentality. Will need to get stronger to handle bigger players defending against him. When he has the space he is a dynamic possession player. Tends to depend more on his own abilities and tend to be a one-man show, refusing to pass the puck to open the ice. Sees himself as the best option on most attacks and the opposition has begun to know that. An exciting highly skilled player and finisher who is exciting to watch.
