Physical Dub defender who has good short area mobility and an active stick. His skating is a work in progress, but it hasn't deter him because positions himself well, and hold gaps. really good head and reads the attack and also sees his outlets well. Displays a good shot, good passes, and although doesn't overplay the puck, when his coordination and feet catch up to his size, he may improve there.
