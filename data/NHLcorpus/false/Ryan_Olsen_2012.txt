Intriguing forward who is still not close to the sum of his parts. Has big, quick, and excellent hands. Skates with a strong stride and good balance. He has good vision, but so far has not shown his talents on a consistent basis. Jekyll-Hyde exemplifies his performances and he lacks the intensity at times one would expect gamers to show when the team needs it.
