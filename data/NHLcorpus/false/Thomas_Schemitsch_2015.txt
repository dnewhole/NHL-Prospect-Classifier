Technically sound big defender who display significant upside. Plays very composed and also has some edge to his game. His long reach and active stick break up passes and clog the lanes. Has a good first pass and is good at activating when the situation calls for him to join the rush. Although he is showing early signs of handling the defensive side and adding the offensive component, he is going to add some jump. Isn’t that good in the corners due to his lack of quickness, and he loses contain. Really needs to get much better in his stop/starts so he isn’t left behind the developing opposing attack.
