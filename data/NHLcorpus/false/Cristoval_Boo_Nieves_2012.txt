Big College Freshman who already has pro-style size, but hasn't played against stiffer competition. He still has room to fill out further. Teams eye his smooth, quick stride that lets him move well in all directions with unusual agility for a bigger player. He moves laterally and gets scoring opportunities, and will not hesitate to drive to the net. Has top-end gears but he must develop the hands of a scorer, and expectations are that he will be more physical. An excellent passer, who quickly moves to open ice after passing the puck. Has seen some time at center and can generate offense with an opportune pass when defenders converge. Still not showing dominance at the level he is playing, so right now he is viewed as a long-term project with significant upside. Projects as a big winger.
