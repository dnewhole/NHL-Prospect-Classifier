Defense-first backliner who is good in transition. Strong positional skater who limits opponents chances due to his calmness and smarts. Plays a make it simple style and uses his teammates as safety valves, and doesn't try and do too much. He may need to improve stop & starts, but moves well laterally, and adding a little more aggression to his game might make him even more desirable. Does have some grit to his game, and since he will be looked at as 3rd pairing guy, that might be a prerequisite to advance. Excellent functional strength and good instincts.  He was selected to the roster for the World Junior Under-18 Tournament in April.
