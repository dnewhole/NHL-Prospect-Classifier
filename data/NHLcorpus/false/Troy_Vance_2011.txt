Big, punishing defender who loves to hit the attackers whether they are in open ice or on the wall. A New York state native raised 40 miles out of NYC, who played in the Philly area until he brought his game to Victoriaville. Skates well for a big man and doesn't embarrass himself when he carries the puck.
