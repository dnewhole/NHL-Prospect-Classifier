Tall lanky defender who moves well for a big man and shows agility and skills to project him as possible NHLer if he continues to work hard and improve his game at the current upward rate. Uses his size to his advantage. Needs work on footwork, mobility,and pivots, because at this point, he cannot play to the speed of the game. Makes clean outlet passes and has good up-ice carries. He was selected to the roster for the World Junior Under-18 Tournament in April.
