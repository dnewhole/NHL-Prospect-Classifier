Good balanced power wing prospect who works hard and is very tough to play against because he comes after you. Far from polished on the offensive side but sees the attack zone well has some skill and a good hard shot. Won’t wow you with dazzling moves but has a two gears and once going, makes his presence felt. A North-South guy who drives on the forceheck and is strong on the biscuit when he gets it back, and is hard to contain. Needs plenty of refinement but does have a 3 zone game and commitment but may find a place as a complimentary player. Had a good U-18 tourney fro the Swiss team. A member of his homeland’s team roster for the World Junior Under-20 at Christmas 2014.
