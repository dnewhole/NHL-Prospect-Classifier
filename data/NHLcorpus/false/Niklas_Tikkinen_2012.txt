Undersized puck-rushing defender who's a shifty carrier with quick feet and mobility. Can control the play, escape pressure and make the first pass. Good in distribution on the PP, but his shot needs work. Is learning the defensive position, since he was solely a forward until 18 months ago. Is stellar along the wall and in one-on-one's. Long term prospect, but displays excellent vision and sense of play. Still must get bigger and gain strength to handle attackers.
