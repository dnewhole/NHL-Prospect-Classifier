Physically strong centre-wing who so far hasn't developed a strong offensive game, but has shown improvement in his hands, and foot speed. Can play all three forward positions maintains a soldier-like competitiveness, never quitting to compete and let you know he's there working his bags off. Good wall player and unearths pucks to give his linemates chances. Is good defensively and gets regular PK minutes. May not look like he has a high water mark with his skill, but handles the puck well, and doesn't ever quit on the play, or himself.
