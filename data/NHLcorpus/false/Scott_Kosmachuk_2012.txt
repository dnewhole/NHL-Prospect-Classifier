Rising prospect with excellent speed, toughness, and two-way game. Plays strong on the puck and displays a fierce willingness to go into battle areas determined to do damage. Anchors well in the crease area. May not be a blazer, but still shows several gears at his speed enough to be a deceptive attacker that defenders have trouble with. He will drop the gloves if necessary, play both penalty kill and power play, and has a high skill set.
