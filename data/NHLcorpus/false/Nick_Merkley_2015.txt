Undersized “Dub” centre/forward with good all around skills and edge. A good skater who can turn into the middle and dish. Very good player from behind the net, whose speed gives him opportunities as he come out. Started the 2014-15 season with league leading point / assist totals. Shorter but very thick. Very willing to get froggy for his team when they are down in a contest and they need some physical. His fireplug frame gives strong body contact and also absorbs the ones returned. A player we will be watching.
