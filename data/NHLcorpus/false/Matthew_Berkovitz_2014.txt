Poised defenseman with great skating fluidity and poise to his game. not a bruiser and not a blazer, but the strength of his play is based on his patient use of his feet as a defender and with his activating on offense.  Great walking the blue line on the PP. Uses his skating to close down on attackers quickly so they have no time or space. Can be cat-like patent, giving the attackers room and time, and then  before they knock he catches that mouse. Not very physical at this point, sticking to basics but has shown he can ratchet up a notch. Was the best back-liner of the Fall elite league. He was a memnber of Team Wisconsin. and has committed to the University of Wisconsin.
