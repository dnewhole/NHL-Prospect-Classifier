Florida-born defender played with Detroit Compuware in midget and posted an impressive 21+/- with the Generals and was a key player in their playoff run. A stay-at-home defender that uses his body on the wall and in front. Makes the good first pass and is a good skater with mobility. Will never be a huge attacker. He will quietly be an effective player at the things he does best.
