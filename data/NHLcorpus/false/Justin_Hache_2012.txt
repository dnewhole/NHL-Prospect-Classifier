Raw Quebec-league defender who is still learning to use his body and hone his offensive & defensive talents. He is playing on a deep veteran Shawinigan team, so sees less ice than if he played elsewhere. So far a defense-first defender who has a quick stick and uses it to break up plays. Needs time and experience. Already has a nice stretch pass, but he is a long term developer.
