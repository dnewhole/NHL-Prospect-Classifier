Under six foot carrier who has very good puck skills, excellent feet and crisp passing ability. he is not going to engage attackers physically, but use his stick to beat them. His puck handling prowess at top speed and his lateral movement help him make excellent decisions on the attack and in his end. He plays strong with the biscuit and is a PP QB and solid transition player. Has a couple gears. Will need time to develop and get physically stronger and thicker.
