An undersized centreman who plays fast and has continually performed well in big games. Excellent face off man, passer and shooter. Quick release, anticipation in the attack and vision. He is an unselfish two-way pivot who sees the ice extraordinarily well and sets things up so smoothly and abundantly. Has a lightning release, good defensive zone coverage and committment, and despite his size, looks like an excellent up and comer.   Good penalty killer. His father Tom is a former NHLer.
