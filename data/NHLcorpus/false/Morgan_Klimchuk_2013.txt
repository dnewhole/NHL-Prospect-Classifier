Sniper, pure and simple. A hard working, superb handed, opportunistic goal scorer that can provide game-changing passes and goals at any moment.  To be an NHL sniper he needs more strength, but he has an elite level "catch and release" shot that happens at top level speed. Still under six foot and room for muscle, but still showed he was an elite junior player at the 2012 World U-17â€™s, scoring 2 goals and 6 points in 5 games for Team Pacific. More of an North-South skater who is good at finding the places to attack and makes scoring chances for himself and linemates with his excellent passing.  He was selected to the roster for the World Junior Under-18 Tournament in April, where he played mostly on the wing.
