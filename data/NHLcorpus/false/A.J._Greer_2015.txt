Playing on talent laden BU roster, his opportunities and heavier workload are yet to come. Itâ€™s apparent he can make an impact in some way in every shift. Excellent size, athleticism and feet. his strong on his skates and defenders have trouble detering him from going where he wants, usually a drive to the net, maybe even taking up shop there. Displays a heavy shot, good passing ability and the desire to win. Will get thicker and his role at BU will expand, so the team that selects him might end up with a real solid left winger.
