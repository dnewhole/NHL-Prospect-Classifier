The son of former NHLer Andrew is good face-off man with an excellent compete level nice speed, and good hands. Plays hard and his heavy shot sees time on the PP. Plays on a talent-laden club, but has not emerged as the cream of that crop, with minimual numbers and appears to be good at all phases, but doesn't stand in any of them at this juncture.
