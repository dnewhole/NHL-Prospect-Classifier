Long term project who makes solid decisions and reads. Displays good vision and hands. Excellent outlet passer and a very good stretch passer.  Decent in his puck decisions. His skating is his bane; heavy feet and a stiff skating motion retard his ability to stop players wide and those with quick lateral moves. He is still able to start offensive plays with board battles. He may be an intriguing prospect once he plays tougher and skates better.
