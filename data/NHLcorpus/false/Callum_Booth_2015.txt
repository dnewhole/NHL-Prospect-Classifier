Quebec goalie prospect with good size, athleticism and technique. Very good going laterally across the crease, and plays the hybrid style with a calm under intense traffic. Has good bounce; will be up watching the attack forming, go down and cover the lower part of the net and hop right back up as the puck moves outside the dots. Good post presence and awareness. A good developmental prospect.
