Excellent defensive defenseman who has an aggressive stick, blocks tons of shots, handles one on ones, strips away pucks and refuses to any room in his zone. Clears the front. Will relieve pressure by carrying the puck out of his zone. Excels on the pK and is a key component to his teamâ€™s success there. His offensive side needs work and he probably needs to be more confident enough with shooting the puck.
