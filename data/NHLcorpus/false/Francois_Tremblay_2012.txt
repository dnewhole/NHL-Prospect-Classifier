Excellent goaltender with size, quick legs, and tons of potential that has scouts scrutinizing him night in and out. The goaltending factory known at the Quebec Major Junior seems to always provide at least one solid advanced prospect with a quick glove and technically sound game. Keeps his team in games when the teams' defense fails. A battler who is exceptional in the trapezoid, and is good with his stick in more ways than that. Squares up well and tracks the puck well. A rising prospect.
