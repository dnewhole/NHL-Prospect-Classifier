Wasn't drafted last year, but his additional college time has caused improvement in this Colorado native's game. Skates and moves well. His arms let him use his stick to clog passing lanes. Added some jam to his play. Besides a tougher style he continues to improve in judgement, skating, and offensive acumen.
