Strong skating centre with good size and agility. Is strong on the puck and at times uses his size down low and on the wall. Displays nice mitts and a quick release.The knock is his lack of sustained physicality and game by game intensity and consistency. When things are happening for a player offensively you expect they pick it up in the defensive zone and good things happen. He doesn't seem to buy into the showing up part.
