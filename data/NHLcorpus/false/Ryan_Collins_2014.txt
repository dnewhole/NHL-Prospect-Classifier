Long tall defenseman who is still gaining strength and growing into his body. His development will take time but he already understands the game and has an active stick, and uses it to disrupt the passing lanes and get to loose pucks in the crease area. He is still learning the transition game and is more comfortable playing it simple in his end. As he gains strength and experience, he will add short area skating quickness and become better with his decisions in his own zone. Plenty of upside at both ends of the ice if he works at it.
