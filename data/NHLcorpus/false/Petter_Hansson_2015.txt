Effective two-way defender with good boots,  calm, and attack instincts. Display a good shot, and can carry-stickhandle while at top gear. Solid passer who maked the right pass from the blueline. His mobility aids him in his work in his end, where he wins back pucks and controls the  tempo if his team comes under pressure.
