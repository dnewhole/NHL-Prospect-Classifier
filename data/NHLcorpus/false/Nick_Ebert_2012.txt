Projects as a number one two-way defender whose size, cool demeanor, vision, and feet will let him contribute both offensively and defensively. By far the best American born prospect in this draft. Plays defense with plenty of nastiness and was well respected in the OHL as a 16 year old in 2010-11. Much has been made of his "immaturity" for not using the summer as an intense preparation period for his draft year, and many felt he was out of shape. This impacted his performance and the larger role that had been planned for him earlier this campaign. It took him awhile to return to the level of play he had displayed at the 2010-11 season's end.
