Prototypical Swedish two way centre who takes care of his end and then thinks the offensive side.  A solid six footer with a solid work ethic decent hands and smart playmaking skills. Likes to wait and hold the puck that split second and wait for lanes to open up. Not a banger but physical enough to go to the front or work all the battle areas. Was Nylander's centre in the World Junior U-18s.
