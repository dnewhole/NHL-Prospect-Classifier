Drafted two seasons ago by Montreal but didn't sign and has re-entered the draft. Strong, big developmental prospect who projects as a wing, but has seen time at center. Made huge strides this season in creating more chances, and gave a more determined effort throughout games. Has a set of gears and a very good skill level, which he has now balanced with a good defensive game. He is now playing with an edge and confidence. Excellent defensive player at forward who diagnoses well and can break up plays. There was talk about him having an attitude and also that he wasn't keeping in game shape with conditioning.
