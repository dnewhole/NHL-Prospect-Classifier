Undersized high tempo centre with a set of high gears, excellent attack skills, nice vision, relentless forecheck and an aggressive 200 foot game. Fearless in traffic and has a decent release and shot, but there are concerns about his smaller size and if he can play with the same consistency as he climbs the rungs.
