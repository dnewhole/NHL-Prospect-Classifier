Western league defender with a solid all-around two-way game.  Very active stick, good gap control and defensive positioning. can make the outlet pass out of his zone, but also carry the mail if it is not an option. In his first full year in the dub he is confident with the puck and physical when separating the attacker from it. Makes the safe outlet pass well. Has a bit of edge to his game.
