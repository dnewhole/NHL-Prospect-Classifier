Big two-way defenseman who plays a smart game, is a good up-ice puck distributor with good vision. Joins the rush and is an exceptional passer on the offense. Has a quick stick and holds good body position on attacking forwards.  Will need to add some snarl to his repertoire.  He has committed to Cornell University.
