A miner's son, who is a big defender with good offensive ability and a solid work ethic. Has the size and willingness to play with physicality besides displaying good offensive skills, soft hands and great patience. Is able to close the gap on attacking junior players, but still needs plenty of improvement on his defensive game, with lateral mobility and footwork being essential. Teams will see the parts of his game that are already in place and decide what his high water mark is. Plenty to like in this emerging longer term project.
