Shifty skilled puckhandler with long stride, speed, vision, and playmaking skills. Can operate at top speed while in possession.  Plays the point on the PP. Very thin and needs weight and muscle. Slick puckhandler who can make plays at high speed. A long strider who looks to teammates but has excellent quickness and acceleration to beat opponenets one-on-one. Can man a point on the PP. Clearly stood out as the top Canadien player in the World junior A Challenge. His downside at this point would be his thin frame and lack of girth. He also needs a 60 minute commitment.He needs strength and teams will also be weary of selecting him because his success has come playing against Tier Two opponents,
