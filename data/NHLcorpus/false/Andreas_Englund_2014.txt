Bigger defender who plays strong on his skates, and displays skill and power from the back line. Far from ready or showing any certain area where he is high end, but the chances of a spike in his development may be coming. Handles the rough going and can give back. Good straight line speed. Reads the situations well, but he is still not handling the puck expertly. The question is can he get a bit more agile and stronger when he has the puck? A member of his homelandâ€™s team roster for the World Junior Under-20 at Christmas 2014.
