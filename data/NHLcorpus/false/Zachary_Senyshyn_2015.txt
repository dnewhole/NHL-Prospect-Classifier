Underrated OHL hard working winger who pays a smart tough well-rounded game. Good physically strong player on the boards and good acceleration and power on the attack. Always in on the backcheck, and although he isn't a lateral skating dynamo, he uses his North-South speed to get moving to the front and stay there when then the attack ensues. Big and powerful, and never takes a shift off.
