Huge defenseman who continues to improve foot speed in his quest to be a shut-down defender. Skates better than you would expect such a big kid. Makes the smart pass out of his end, and has recorded multi-point games. big men that move like this cannot be ignored,  where the problem lies, is he is someone who project as a stay at home defender at the higher levels, but his present game is not one that displays a big man throwing his weight or showing ruggedness. He in fact looks soft, and uninterested in that role. Still, there is time for an awakening.
