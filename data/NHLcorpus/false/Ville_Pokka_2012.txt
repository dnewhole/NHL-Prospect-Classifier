Two-way Finn defender who takes the body on the wall and slot. He passes the puck really well, and is an effective distributor no matter where he is on the ice. Good PP puck distributor who has really good  one-timer. Doesn't possess star level ability, but has great upside. Still might cave under pressure, but it takes a lot to rattle him to the point of a major mistake. By far not a complete finished product, but plenty to like about his upside. Must work to get his feet moving quicker, and make better decisions in his defensive zone. Carries the biscuit as well as anyone.
