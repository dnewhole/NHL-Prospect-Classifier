Tough, stay-at-home defender with some offensive upside. His skating is a work in progress. Stick skills need work. Great at the junior level of controlling the gaps. Siemens understands he has to be nasty defender and improve all other facets, and he is dedicated in doing so. It is just a matter of when his name gets called based on what the present package is.
