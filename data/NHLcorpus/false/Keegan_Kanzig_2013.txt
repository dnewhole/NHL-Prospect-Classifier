Projects as a big physical defenseman who takes care of business in his end, seeing plenty of minutes against the top opposition lines and on the PK. Skates well and closes gaps and clogs lanes with his stick. He doesn't display an advanced offensive side or do too much puck carrying, but plays to his strength with success. Plays with and edge, and doesn't lose fights. A bit more quickness will only improve his ablity to play his style.
