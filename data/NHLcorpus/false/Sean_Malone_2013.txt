Speedy centreman who plays well in tight space. Excellent speed and gears to blow by even the best of junior defenders. Can cut on a dime and handle plays at his top gear after. Defensively responsible and always quick back to his own end on dee. Persistent forechecker. Really good release on his shot. His speed and relentless motor makes him a fine prospect.
