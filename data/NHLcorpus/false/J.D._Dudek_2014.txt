Prep school Centre-wing who has a compact solid body and good hockey smarts. His biggest strength is his playmaking as he strings things and waits for things to develop before passing. Has good balance and jump, and is more meat and potatoes as an attacker who will take a hit to make a play, but tends to be a perimeter. Not over physical on either end, but hopefully when he gains strength and girth as he advances, he plays a more complete game as an attacker and a defender. Was named to the USA Developmental team playing in the Ivan Hlinka Tournament. Committed to Boston College
