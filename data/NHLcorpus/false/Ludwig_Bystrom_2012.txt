Another Swedish defensive prospect who has good long term potential, but is far from the polished product. He displays excellent all-direction feet and makes poise puck decisions, has good vision and very good passing ability. His skating must continue to improve, but he is already smart positionally, and closes down well. Takes the body when needed and, although not a real up-ice guy, he is cool on the point, strong at passing, and good getting to loose pucks.
