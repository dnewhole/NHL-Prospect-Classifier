Rising Swedish rearguard with great skating abilities, physically, and offensive upside. His fluidity, lateral speed, and pivoting ability allow him to control gaps, close lanes defensively. His smooth puck handling skills make him a transition horse as he reads the ice well and plays with patience. Power play general with a nice shot and stick skills to take advantage of any slide-downs to the slot. He reads the ice well in all zones and looks to be another good prospect for a team looking for a defender.
