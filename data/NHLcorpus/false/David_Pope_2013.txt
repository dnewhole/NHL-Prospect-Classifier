Big Fluid winger who is a second year eligible player with skills. Had an injury-marred season partially due to his attempts to play like a heavyweight when his body is still at featherweight. Displays good hands, feet and  nice shot, but needs to get stronger and buk up to continue upward development. Must be viewed as a long term project. Headed to the U of Nebraska-Omaha.
