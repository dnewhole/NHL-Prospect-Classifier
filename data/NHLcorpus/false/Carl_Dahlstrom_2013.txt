Strong large molded Swedish defenseman that is refining his game. Active, smart ,fluid and strong on the puck when in possession. Has good feet, improved stick-handling and is showing he belongs on the draft lists. Possesses a big hard shot. Does so many things good dee-men already. Makes the outlet pass, closes his gaps, clearing the crease, etc. Plays big time minutes, and an strong defensive side. He has plenty of developing to do, but has outstanding upside.
