Offensive wing who stands equal to any stickhandler in this draft class. Was called upon to be the main man on a club in need of more offensive threats. He plays on the power play, and is not a player who neglects his responsibilities in his own zone. He has continued to add leg strength and all-around muscle. After being traded, he had both knee and concussion injuries, but still finished with 40 points. This season, he had over 60 points before February. His size may work against him, but his not afraid of bigger competitors and will stand up for himself against them with his fists.
