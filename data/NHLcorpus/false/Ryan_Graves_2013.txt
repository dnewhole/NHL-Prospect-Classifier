Big defender who doesn't shy away from fights and the rough going. Was named the major midget leagueâ€™s top rookie defenceman for the 2010-2011 major midget hockey season. Still developing and adjusting to the quicker pace of junior, he is nonetheless an excellent long term developmental prospect of defense.
