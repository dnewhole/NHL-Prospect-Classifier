An athletic Slovakian import who has soundly placed himself in the conversation as possibly being the first goaltender drafted. He was clearly heads over tails better than any other prospect at the NAHL showcase event. Shows a good down low came with quick legs. Has good balance while in his stance, and terrific quickness and anticipation. Good at absorbing shost and limiting rebounds. Covers the top of the net and is flexible enough in recovery and reposition for the second shot he does give up.
