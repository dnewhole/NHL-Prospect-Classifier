While a member of Phénix du Collège Esther-Blondin, was named the MVP of the Telus Cup, the Canadian national midget championship. Put his name into the conversation with a strong two goal prospects game. He plays on both the PP & PK, and wants the puck on his stick. Still very thin, he will need strength and weight training to continue to play past the junior level. He has excellent hands and instincts. He goes to the net extremely well. He was selected to the roster for the World Junior Under-18 Tournament in April.
