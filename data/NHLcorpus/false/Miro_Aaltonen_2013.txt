Smaller buzz-bomb of an attacker who gets on the opposition so well they start to resent it. Using his great balance and speed, he takes pucks away, and never stops working back into his own zone. Has a shot and is simply difficult to play against. The second year eligible suffered a devasting ankle injury during the opening game of the World Junior for team Finland. He was arguably their leader and one of the top players. Undersized but already a successful scorer and regular in the Finnish pro league playing against men. Father was a Finnish pro player. This is his third and last year of eligibility.
