All-around defenseman with size, excellent speed, and a strong two-way game.  Is not a physical defender but will use his size to wall players off. Has an active stick in the defensive zones, and displays lateral mobility. Has good jump and carries the puck well and makes crisp outlet passes. Needs work in all phases, and projects are a long term developmental selection.
