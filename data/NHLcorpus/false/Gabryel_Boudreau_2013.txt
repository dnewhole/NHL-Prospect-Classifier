Displays good speed, and offensive gifts. A developing first year player, who shows creativity on the attack, but needs to continue growing stronger. Plays at a high rate of speed and handles the puck well. Will never be a large guy, but he is a creative sniper with superb first step acceleration, and tremendous cutting ability to go with quick passes, and a good wrister. Kills penalities and ahs been asked to be a shutdown centre too.
