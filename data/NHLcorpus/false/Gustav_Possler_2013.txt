Developing scoring wing who displays ability to make plays in high gear. Has a quick jump and although not a real lateral player, weaves well in traffic. Reads coverages and gets open. Plays strong on the puck when pressured, and can be clever when called upon to be. He is more a finisher than set up guy, and is very disciplined to get back in transition and back check for pucks. At this juncture isn't strong enough to dominate, but when he is, he may be good pro up & down North-South skater with ability to pot some goals and provide opportunistic scoring chances on the attack.
