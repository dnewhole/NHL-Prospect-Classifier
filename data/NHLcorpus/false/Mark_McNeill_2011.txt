Strong skating center who is growing into a role as an aggressive big center. Not a ballerina-type but a North-South skater with nice balance, agility, speed, and skating stride. He is an unpolished young center, still learning to skate the puck. He has good hands, passes the puck very well, and is growing in his improvement and aggressive play. He is a rising prospect who may be long gone before this pick.
