Big defender who can play with some physicality. The real positives is that he already skates so very well and fluid for a large man. Has quick feet and can close laterally too. Pivots real well, and have good control while skating, and being able to position himself strikingly fast to chase & defend, or get to pucks and pass them up in transition. Can play hard and strong and battle in the corners and on the wall. At this point, most teams will like what they see, but hope for a bit more of an offensive game.
