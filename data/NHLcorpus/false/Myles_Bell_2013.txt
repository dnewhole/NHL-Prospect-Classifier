Started his junior career as  promising offensiveman at this juncture, but some off ice issues has retarded his selection chances in the two past seasons. Offense is his game, but in no way a one trick pony though. Has some gumption to throw the big check, and is working on being a better positionally strong defender. If you're buying, it is because of his abilities going up-ice and his long passing skills. Makes stickhandling and passing look easy. Huge point shot.
