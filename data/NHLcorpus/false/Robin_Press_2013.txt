Tall lanky Swedish defenseman who didn't play defense solely until Christmas 2011, making him a long term project with a possible big reward. Excellent outlet passer and already has the stretch pass down. Is very comfortable with the puck on his stick and not bothered by heavy hitting. He must build an aggressive physical game of his own, but that will be part of the long term development.
