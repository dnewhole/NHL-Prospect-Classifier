Solid wing with great strength and some abilities to generate and also score. Reads the ice well, finds the open spots, has good feet and size, and has scoring prowess. Is less a puck carrier than a soft area guy who knows where to be to get the puck back. Scored 30 goals as a WHL rookie in 2011-12, but production stalled as the year was ending. Needs improved first step quickness.
