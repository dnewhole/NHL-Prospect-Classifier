With the lack of high-end sure thing rushing offensivemen in the draft class, this long term project has superb feel and hockey sense, a good feeling for the attack, and makes tape to tape passes. His shot is fairly weak, and his defensive game is far from poised and his physicality is nonexistent. Has the tools but needs development to his body and his game.
