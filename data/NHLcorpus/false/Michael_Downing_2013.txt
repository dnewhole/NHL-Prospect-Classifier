Big defender that is coming into his own. Shows physicality, a quick stick, long reach, mobility, and skill. Displays excellent reach, and poise when he has the puck, and passes very well up ice. Is not a polished up ice guy or on the PP, but shows potential to develop into a strong defensive defenseman who will control areas with his stick and physicality. His defensive game is a work in progress, his transition game will only get better. Tremendous upside. Committed to the University of Michigan.
