Part three of the Whalers big line. Hard working competitor who plays with jam all over the offensive zone. Opportunistic in the area between the circles and seems to score on rebounds with his hard snapper. Good wall player. Average hands, average feet, but a hard worker who seems to like to do a bit of talking to the enemy.
