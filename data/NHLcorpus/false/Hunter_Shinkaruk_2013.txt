Established himself as a scorer in the "Dub" early on with excellent vision, hockey smarts, and skill. The upper-echelon wheels, stick-handling, and ability to find the soft spots in open ice, override his current stature and frame. Very strong on his skates, always able to come back and help in his zone, and has excellent offensive instincts. Had great hands and makes plays in tight. Scored over 40 goals in 2011-12. Plays with a whole bit of nasty, and fills the agitator's role, game in and game out, despite not being a physical force. An intense Stan Mikita-type presence that is bringing it with scoring and bite on a consistent basis.
