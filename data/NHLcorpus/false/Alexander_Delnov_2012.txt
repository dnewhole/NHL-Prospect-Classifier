Russian left-handed right wing with a strong stride and mulitple set of gears. Excellent hands and a strong 200-foot game. Solid skater with functional strength, good puck-handling ability, and a good sense to get open or recognize whom is. Works in all three zones and has surprising lateral ability and a quick release.
