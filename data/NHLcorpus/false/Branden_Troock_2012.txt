Potential power winger has good enough feet to be effective in transition and in getting to the openings on offense. He could stand to gain leg strength and get quicker in his first two steps, but once he gets up stream he is hard to stop and drives to scoring areas. He was second in the CHL prospects game skills competition for fastest skater. He needs to improve his playmaking and scoring abilities, but is no stranger to the battle areas or being a physical force along the wall. He is learning to stand up for himself and teammates, and is getting noticed by scouts as a good developmental selection.
