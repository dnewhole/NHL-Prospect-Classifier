Big wing who will do the dirty work to unearth pucks in the battle zones, take hits, stand in front, and show prowess below the hash marks. Not the best skater but has balance and fair speed. Needs to be more of a player along the wall, and give a better effort away from the puck. Combined with good hand/eye coordination, vision, solid passing skills, and a quick release hard wrister, there is lots to like.
