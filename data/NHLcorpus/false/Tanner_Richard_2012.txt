Shifty speed player who had experience playing against men in the Swiss A league. Stronger than his slight build appears, he is a shifty puck carrier who can beat defenders one on one with his stick. Also uses power in the corners and along the wall. He plays smart and is the first guy in, ready to place hard hits on the forecheck. His defense is a work in progress but he is a gifted offensive player. He is an offensive generator at even strength who may become more of a goal-scorer once he is thicker and stronger.
