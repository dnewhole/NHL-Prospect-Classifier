PP centreman who already is physically developed and displays a knack when he has the puck on his stick. Not the quickest player, but does move powerfully when he keeps the legs moving.  He is a nice player, just not one that explodes as a top flight offensive prospect. He could, though, develop into a shutdown forward. Can use his size to his advantage on the opposition. Needs to improve his stop/starts, and continue to the defensive commitment and his play away from the puck that his Coach Brent Sutter has instilled. Makes good passes. Has a heavy shot but needs to improve his release time. He must spend more time moving his legs instead of coasting and waiting for things to happen in both the offensive and defensive zones.
