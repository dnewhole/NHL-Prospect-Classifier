Elite skater, strong puck-handler, and good passer. Was voted co-holder of the Michigan Mr. Hockey award for the top high school player with Gerald Mayhew. Graduated to Windsor, where he is one of the first on PK, and uses his grit along with his speed to apply strong pressure. Relished the role as a shut-down defensive player, and uses his speed to throw himself into the fray, and also to get in the lanes and break up the attacks. He is small-framed and gets bounced around at this point, but there is no taking away his ability to play at a high energy level with success. Must get bigger and stronger.
