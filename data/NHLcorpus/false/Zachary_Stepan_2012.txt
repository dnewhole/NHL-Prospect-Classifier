His brother is a New York Ranger, and that helps explain his team-oriented tone, where he leads by example. He plays strong on his skates and simply tries to outwork the opposition with his puck pursuit and work. He has good balance, nice long strides, and shoots a heavy puck. More of a North-South skater but shows a nice upside as he progresses, although he doesn't project as a top six offensive performer. He is more of a battler and guy you want in the circle to take key face-offs and play against the opposition's top lines at the end of games to preserve the lead.
