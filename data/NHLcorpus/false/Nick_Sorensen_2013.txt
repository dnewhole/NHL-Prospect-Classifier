Hightly-touted Danish-Swedish prospect needed reconstructive surgery on his ACL & MCL and will not play again until this 2012-13 season. Prior to the injury, he displayed tremendous first steps, a set of gears that combined with his passing and smarts to project him as a player with significant upside. His development has been stifiled by the rule which limits each team in the "Q" to only suit two European born players per team, and his Quebec team has "vets" Grigorenko and Kucherov ahead of him. He is a rising prospect whose draft slotting may be decided on him playing more. It was thought that Quebec would trade him, but he did get playing time until Grigorenko returned from Buffalo. he still managed 20 goals and 47 points in 46 games during the season, and 7 goals, 10 points in 8 games in the QMJHL playoffs.
