Dominant foward prospect with strong rifle and tremendous puch handling skills. Strong two way wing with great hustle and jump. Wins board battles and drives to the front and creates traffic. Plays bigger than his present size and out-muscles and out plays bigger opposing players. Owns the corners and the wall and strips the puck from the enemy. Dominant at cente and probably can play anywhere up front. A puck possession player with a nifty wrister to boot.
