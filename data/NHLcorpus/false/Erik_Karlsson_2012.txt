Thin bodied center/wing who has excellent acceleration and speed. This spindle-legged Swede is a deadly shooter with a quick release and nose for the net. Maybe it is the need to bulk up and get stronger, but he seems to run out of gas and that commitment can result in goals late. Early on he flew to the corner to unearth a rebound, but later he was nowhere to be found. He'd shoot and then go to the front for his own rebound and later shy away from the front. He will continue to get bigger, stronger and hopefully become a sixty minute player.
