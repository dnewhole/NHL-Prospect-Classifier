One of the top Minnesota prospects he is a smart centre-forward who plays a strong two-way game. He plays as strong passing centre with a power game and three zone responsibility, and could also project to the wing. Has a frame with room to fill out into, and already plays physical. at his present size. Strong on the wall with a really nice shot. Shoews some dangle. If his hands improve, so will his chances to advance up the ladder.
