Possible sleeper who plays in the Swedish Elite league has many of the qualities that the NHL has found in past selections from Sweden, except he isn't a towering presence, or at this point, a solid defender. What he does bring is an excellent all-around skill set, great wheels, and strong up-ice vison and instincts. Teams may look at him as a guy they select with the thought that his all around defensive game rounds out. Gamble or not, there is a pretty good chance he gets chosen at some point.
