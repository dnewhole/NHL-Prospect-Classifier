Flyer with game breaking ability and snarl. Tremendous shot, powerful burst with a great feel for offensive. Can be creative with the pass or let go a heavy blast or one-timer. Strong skater with the ability to spurt through and around defenders and has enough edge to compete against anyone. Plays bigger than he is. Good in the dot. Is passionate as a defensive forechecker and attacker to the front. Strong on the puck and fearless yet undersized. He might be the hidden fireplug of the crop.
