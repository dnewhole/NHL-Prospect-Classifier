Puck-moving defenseman who is positionally strong on his skates and an excellent puck-handler. Undersized and in need of more muscle, he is a gambler type, who is a high risk-high reward player. Great moving laterally. Has a tendency to force the play with individual efforts over the safe play. If he grows, he will fly up the draft boards.
