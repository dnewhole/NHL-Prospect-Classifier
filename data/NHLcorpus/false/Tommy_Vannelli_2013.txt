Aggressive offensive defender with a top gear, who is equally assertive defensively. Tremendous stride and balance.  Offensive gambler who wants to make things happen and skates the puck very well, and is dangerous in transistion. Shows strong physicality in his own zone, and although unpolished, and still not showing top strength at this juncture, he shows good upside. He still has lots to learn and work on, but the guy is simply leads by example with plenty of enthusiasm. Tremendous upside based on his all around infectious all around aggressive energy and effortless jump. He was selected to the roster for the World Junior Under-18 Tournament in April, and scored a big goal against the Russian team.  He is committed to the University of Minnesota.
