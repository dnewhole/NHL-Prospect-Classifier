Big, prototypical Russian defenseman who can play all phases and skate well against the better opponents. A blood disorder slowed him this season, and if he was a bit more physical, he could be special. Wonderful lateral mobility and excellent passer with great hands to receive them too. Smart all over the ice, strong in front of his nets, and solid in all phases. Good passer and team guy. Solid balanced skater who sees the ice well, jumps up in transition, shows offensive patience, and is gifted with soft hands for receiving and dishing the puck.
