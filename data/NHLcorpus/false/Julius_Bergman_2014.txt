A longer term prospect who has shown glimpses as a good puck mover and decision-maker. Can join the rush and jump in as the fourth man and is strong on the puck. Plays a bit too tentative, as if he is unsure and can't decide when to commit, make the pass, or start moving and ends up out of position. The fact that he is has good size, but doesn't use it, and seems to get intimidated doesn't inspire scouts to call his name.
