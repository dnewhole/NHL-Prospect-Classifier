Good two-way disciplined player who is already an excellent face-off man and is a surprisingly good player for a rookie. Already playing in key situations and handling the pressure. He is a guy who will stand in front and work through the trash, putting in rebounds. Plays in all situations and can play on any line. Good PP & PK guy, and a willing shot-blocker.
