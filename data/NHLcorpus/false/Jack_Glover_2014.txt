Rising Team USA defender with size, four direction skating ability and poise which projects him as a top round pick.  A confident passer and strong defensive zone player. Excellent passer even under pressure. Makes the stretch pass with success. Remains unshaken under pressure in his end and is physically able to handle attackers. Positions himself really well and is always aware of the entire ice, and is able to slow things down and calm situations while under forechecking pressure. Big smart defenseman with nice upside.
