Big left-handed centre-wing who has some touch and is unafraid to stand up for his teammates.  His over-all game is a work in progress and his first two steps, and mobilty have him tycast already as more of a North-South guy that has to work to stay with the play. At this juncture, he gets in the battle araes and uses his size to out-muscle and work pucks free and cause havoc in front.  He does have decent hands too. He does his best to block shots and use his size in his defensive zone. A very willing combatant too. Teams will have to decide whether they think he can to be a better shooter and shooter as they decide on his slottng. Projects as that front cloggingcentre and willing disruptor.
