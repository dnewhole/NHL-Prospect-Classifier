A Finn offensiveman who needs plenty of development in his own zone, but already displays high end offensive talent with his vision, offensive instincts and pin-point passes. An four-direction skater with tremendous agility and glide that provides him the ability to skate the puck out of his end, using his agility and terrific turns. Can hit a player with a pass at his top speed. Makes soft touch passes, evem with outlets. The question remains if he can put together his game in the defensive zone.
