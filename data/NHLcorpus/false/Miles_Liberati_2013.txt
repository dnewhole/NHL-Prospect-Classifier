Played on a stacked roster in London, he saw much less time than most other prospects, but will have a bigger role next season. He is very mobile quick and a good passer and offensive generatot from the back end. He just need reps to improve his game and play in more pressurred situations to gain experience. His long term future looks to be on an upswing.
