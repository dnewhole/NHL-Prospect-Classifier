Left wing prospect with a nice frame whose has all-around game and makes any linemate a good player. Outstanding straight line speed., but needs to improve his balance. Plays well in all areas and comes to play shift after shift. He has strength but needs to get better in the battle areas. Very consistent and was able to outplay the opposition and winning puck battles again and again. Can get bigger all round. And improving in the tight spaces and capitalizing there is what might elevate his draft status.
