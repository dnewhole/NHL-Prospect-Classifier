Great bloodline in this smaller but gifted package that  can generate chances from all forward positions and from the backline as an attacker. Has excellent agility and offensive instincts as a defenseman. Good in transition and gets by defensively with good positioning. At the high school level was an excellent penalty killer too. Did I mention he is Lou nanne's grandson?
