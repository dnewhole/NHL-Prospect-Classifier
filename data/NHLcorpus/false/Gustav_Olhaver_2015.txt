A giant six and half foot left winger who is a very good skater and competes hard in all areas. Itâ€™s rare to find players thus size with strong leg drive and balance. Very tough for other junior players to slow him down. He is tough to match-up against oblong the wall and in the front, where he drives hard and fights for the rebounds. Clearly a player that is now on the radar as a long term developing big man. Nice prospect for a team willing to watch him build on his game and physical stature.
