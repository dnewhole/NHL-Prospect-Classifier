A rugged win who also has pretty soft hands. Big and willing to do whatever helps to et the win. You know you played against him, as he competes his bags off, going very hard not the corners and delivering hits that hurt. Very rugged and an agitator who will drop the gloves with anyone. Not a goon;plays a honest hard game much to the liking of his teammates but to the dislike of their opponents. Always one of the most consistent players on his team in every game. A top six candidate who can eventually be a physical force on an NHL roster due to his size, edge and unmatched work ethic.
