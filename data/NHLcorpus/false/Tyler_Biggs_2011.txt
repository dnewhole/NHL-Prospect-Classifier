Big three zone, mean wing who will probably have to continue to upgrade his quickness to be a force at the next level. He is a tough, on-ice leader/protector and will lay heavy checks within the rules in almost every game he plays. He has nice balance, a wide skating base and a solid quick stride. Yet Biggs is basically a North-South guy who has an accurate shot, soft hands, and a pro-style build. Thus his goals will come in the crease area where he will cause major disruptions when he anchors down in front and on passes he unearthed along the wall. His father (Don) was a longtime minor pro player. There really is little to not like about him if he is given a slower track to continue his improvement.
