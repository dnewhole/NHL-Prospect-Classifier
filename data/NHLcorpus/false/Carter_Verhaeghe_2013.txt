Raw but developing long term prospect who plays centre but may also project as a wing.  His skating has a hitch in it but I wouldn't say he cannot improve the stride. He does have a good burst and very good control of the biscuit when on the move. He is good in the dot. He sees and reads the offenisve zone. Handles the defensive zone well. Good hands in terms of stickhandling, but seems to have a poor release and never be a scorer. He nonetheless is an intriguing guy teams may look to as a guy farther down the road, as he clearly can play most phases well in junior. He was selected to the roster for the World Junior Under-18 Tournament in April.
