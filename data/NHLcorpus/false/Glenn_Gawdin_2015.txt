Two-way centre with excellent balance and quick strike capability. Plays the point on the power play, but isn't a true finisher. Can shoot the puck while in stride. and is very light on his edges. Needs to develop physically and he has honed his passing and middle zone work. Can shoot while in flight, and supports his linemates well. Blossoming centreman who is light on his edges and does all the things his lien needs to be successful in support, picks, and screens. Far from physically developed, some team will call his name and hope he fills out his frame, gets stronger and makes a leap to the pro game. Long term prospect who seems to be developing with every game.
