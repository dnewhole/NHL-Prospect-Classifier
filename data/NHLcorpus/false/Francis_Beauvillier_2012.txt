Active fleet center who shoots the puck extremely well. At the CHL Prospects game, he bested seven other contestants in one lap around the rink competition with a 14.132 second score. Was asked to participate in the NHL Research & Development Camp in August. Billed as a quick power type wing with jam, he seemed to show little scoring consistency, jam, and failed to play an intense game. Did show up more prominently during his team's playoff run. Possesses tons of the skills that NHL teams look for in forwards. It remains to be seen if he commits to further development.
