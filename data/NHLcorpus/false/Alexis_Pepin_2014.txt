A big man who shows grit and competitive spirit. His size and ferocity cause opponents fits in the attack zone as he makes contact with impact. Good all around player and decent in his defensive zone. The knock comes by the fact that while he is a good skater, he just doesn't have that quickness you would like on the attack. In small areas, there really isn't an issue, and he can set up, move out, and stay with opponents. The questions them becomes is he a player that can eventually play in your top six, or can he continue as a centre effectively at higher competition levels.
