Solid defense-first player who plays all phases very very well, but not an elite offensive standout. Averaged sized player with a more simple game that effectively gets his team out of trouble with good decision-making and the clean outlet pass. His skating allows him to have a good offensive game moves the puck well and is fairly careful to never do too much in the attack zone. Still far from polished, with he will have to gain power in the legs and improve further defensively. He was selected to the roster for the World Junior Under-18 Tournament in April.
