Undersized dee-man who is a good puckhandler and up-ice puck carrier. Very competitive and fearless in his play. Reads the ice well in both ends.  Can avoid pressure from forecheckers and make the transition pass.  Has good vision. QBs the powerplay. Has strong recovery speed to get back after activating. Despite his size he comes ready to play against players larger than his stature.
