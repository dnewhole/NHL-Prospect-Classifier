Big skilled two-way defender who  committed to Boston College. Plays to his size with strong physicality in the front and on the wall. Has good functional strength and can handle physical attackers. Skates well and has good skill when he has the puck. Has the potential and demeanor to continue to work hard to be an extremely talented player. Doesn't get ruffled in the defensive zone and stays cool with his puck decisions back there. If he develops a bit more edge, he could have a nice future.
