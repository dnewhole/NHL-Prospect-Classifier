Boom or Bust Russian giant who clearly exhibits strong attacking abilities with superb acceleration, strong on the puck, a quick release, soft hands, and a big frame that easily could win pucks in the battle areas, if he had the game in/game out willingness to do so. He has a shot, and all the tools. It will either come together for him with on-ice hard work or he will never see the North American shores.
