Versatile player with willingness to aggressively compete. Is very good on the cycle, but has balance issues. Shows some grit in his forecheck. Strong shot. He needs to improve footspeed, foot work and his skill levels in all phases. There is some upside, the question is just how much.  He was selected to the roster for the World Junior Under-18 Tournament in April.
