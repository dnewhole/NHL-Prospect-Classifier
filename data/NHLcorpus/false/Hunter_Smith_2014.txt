Gianormous winger who uses his size in all phases. He uses his good hands and reach which combined with grit and intimidation help him make solid plays in both ends of the ice. Can be plain nasty and force opponents into situations were they drop their gloves and hope for the best. Has a very high bar to achieve the status of an all around prospect, but if he continues to improve his game, feet and hands could be a diamond.
