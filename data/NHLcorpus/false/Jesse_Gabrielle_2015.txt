Truculent wing whose offensive side has taken a big jump forward. Throwback player who finished every check and enjoys engaging any and all in scrums, fights, with a perpetual chips on his shoulders. Still not really six foot, he is a wide, muscular specimen and core strength that grounds him into the ice and has few able to restrain his movements. Has a compact stride and is a very good stickhandler in tight spaces. Can release shots quickly and keeps his feet moving in the attack zone, getting loose and making plays.
