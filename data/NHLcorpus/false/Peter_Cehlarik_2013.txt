One of the younger players in the Swedish Elitserien, he has a high skill level and excellent wheels for a big man, with a quick release. Has a powerful stride and excellent balance. Not fast but quick, with soft hands and some dangle. Protects the puck well and has good instincts. He has a high long term upside as he develops playing against older and better players. He was selected to the roster for the World Junior Under-18 Tournament in April.
