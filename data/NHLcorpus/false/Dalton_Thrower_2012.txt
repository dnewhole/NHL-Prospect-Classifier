Tough battler who plays strong on his skates and has some offensive ability. Not tall but wide. Fearless defenseman who plays an intense style that brings bad news to attackers who attempt to occupy the crease or venture into the corners. Good open ice body-checker. Plays strong on his skates, and keeps his position. Expertly makes the outlet and is also willing to move up in the rush. Another defensive prospect from the Dub, except he is a defender who can run the power play, throw big aggressive checks, and is always willing to drop'em.
