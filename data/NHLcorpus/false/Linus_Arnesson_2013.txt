Big skilled Swede defender already playing in the Super-elite league. Tremedous upside based on toughness skill, smarts and feet. Maintains gaps as his four-way skating abilty let's him close down quickly. Up ice you won't see him going lateral but concentrating on straight ahead and head manning the puck. Sees the ice well, plays mistake-free, and is an excellent touch passer. Solid two way defender who thinks defense first and despite limited offensive upside and little snarl to his defensive game is an excellent prospect.
