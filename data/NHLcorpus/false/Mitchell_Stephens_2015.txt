Versatile and passionate right winger who plays in all situations including PK and PP. Makes very good puck decisions and is a smart passer who distributes the puck on the attack whether it be back to the point or to the open man, or firing it on net. An excellent neutral zone player who, after intercepting pucks caught the opposition flat-footed as he entered his attack zone. Not a big guy but has adequate size. Needs more muscle and a lot more jam when working the wall.
