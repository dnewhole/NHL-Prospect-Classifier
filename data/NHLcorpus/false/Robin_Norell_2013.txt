He was selected to the roster for the World Junior Under-18 Tournament in April 2013, where the smaller defender showed he was a mobile puck mover  who passes the puck extremely well and displays solid awareness and composure in the defensive zone. Has excellent mobility and is above average in transition. Pivots well, and has shown he can engage and close on defense. Will have to get bigger and stronger but looks like a prospect with upside.
