Developing player with excellent straight-line speed and nice touch in his set-ups. Strong at using is body to hurl punishing checks. Was at his best in the QMJHL playoffs against top junior scorers Ehler & Drouin. Is hockey smart in the defensive zone as well as having long term offensive upside. Competes his bags off and is hard to play against. Has a good release, and plays both PK & PP.  Has a chance to develop into an excellent player at making opposition players who are usually strong on the puck weak, by virtue of his determination.
