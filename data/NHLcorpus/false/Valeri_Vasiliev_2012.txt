Raw Russian prospect who has good feet, although average in traffic, good lateral mobility, and terrific balance and pivoting ability. Stockily built, he is tank-like in his hits on attackers in front and on the wall. Plays with a bit of nasty for 60 minutes. What will be called in to question is whether he will be able to progress in the other phases of his defensive game, and in his understanding of positioning. Loves contact but loses sight of his job out there.
