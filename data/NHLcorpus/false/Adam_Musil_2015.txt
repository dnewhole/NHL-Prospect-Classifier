A centre with good bloodlines and the versatility to play on all different lines from scoring to checking to energy because he is defensively responsible. A good passer who can also receive pucks while in top flight. Not a real scorer; his shots lack directionality and deceptiveness. Doesnâ€™t have terrific feet, but is improving his mobility, Has good hands and will be aggressive on attacking the one on one defenders before they can go for strips. Strong player on the cycle, and never turns pucks over. Can overhandle the puck or turn his head downward and loses vision of openings his teammates have found. Needs time and development.
