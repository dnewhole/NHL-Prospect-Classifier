Aggressive Russian defender who is tall and slender and more of a stay-home defenseman. Shows good lateral mobility and gets the puck up ice with good passes. Although he is still developing physically, he plays extremely tough and edgy. Never going to be an offensive upside handler, but already seems to play well within the limits of his capabilities. He was selected to the roster for the World Junior Under-18 Tournament in April.
