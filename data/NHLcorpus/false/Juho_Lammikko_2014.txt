Winger who plays hard and has a decent wrist shot. A determined two-way player, who lacks creativity, great feet, or puck skills, so he sticks to a fairly simple game. Plays very hard on the puck and is a good in tight. Is a problem in the paint and along the boards, and is always willing to get dirty and pay the price. handles the puck at high his top speed, and is pretty fast. Was called up to the senior team. Looks like a long term project, but one worth the wait.
