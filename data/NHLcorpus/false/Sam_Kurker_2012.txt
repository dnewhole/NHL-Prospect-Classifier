Larger wing who causes problems for the opposition at both ends. A very good forechecker. Shows decent passing and shooting abilities, enough to think that he can ascend the ladder to the pros. Has a strong wrist shot and is a good skater who has some grit to his game. Is at his best when going North-South and playing physical. He has committed to Boston University.
