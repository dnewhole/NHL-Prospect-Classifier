A workhorse defender for the WheatKings with edgy physicality and some offensive creativity. Has an excelllent one-timer and a deceptive no-look wrister. Strong tape to tape passer. Started as a player who relied mostly on his physicality but has progressed in other areas. Still need work but all the signs seem to point to this player who has been on the radar for several seasons putting all the pieces together
