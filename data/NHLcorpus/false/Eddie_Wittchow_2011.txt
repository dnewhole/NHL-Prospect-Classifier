Physical high school D-man who can score as well as a forward. He has come out of relative absurdity to capture a spot in the draft's top three rounds. He has excellent mobility and a whole lot of nasty. A Minnesota All-Stater, he scored 13 goals displaying a shot, speed, smarts and snarl. May decide to attend Wisconsin, his parent's alma mater. A long-term project that could be real sleeper.
