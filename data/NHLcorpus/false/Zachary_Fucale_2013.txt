Top goalie prospect in North America at this juncture. Last season he lead his team in the first round of the QMJHL playoffs with four wins and an under 2.00 GAA, until the talent-laden Remparts lit him up. This season he has lost very few games. Displays good lateral mobility, and strong techincal skills. Cool, calm competitor with an aggressive style who stand tall and square up well, and has good fluidity.
