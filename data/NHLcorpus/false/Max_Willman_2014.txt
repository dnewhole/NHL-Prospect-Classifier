Second year eligible centre with very good puck skills and a deceptively fast energizer bunny with great lateral mobility and edging. Can make plays at a high tempo.  Clocks in at six foot and 180 and will need to get stronger.A longer range prospect who might develop into more of a complimentary offensive generator. Committed to Brown University.
