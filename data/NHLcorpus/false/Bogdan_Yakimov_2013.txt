Huge big-framed centre with good jump and excellent lateral movement. Excellent passionate competitor who can control the wall. Plays strong on the puck, and can look for the open man if he gets free, but likes to take the shot over trying to draw things to him and passing it off.  Is a load to move from the front once he bulls his way in and plants. Big heavy shot and quick release. May be an up and comer if his upward progression continues, and he gets better handling the puck on the move, and improves his skating.
