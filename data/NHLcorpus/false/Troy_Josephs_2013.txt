Solid wing prospect who has excelled in the OJHL, but as of yet to see tougher opposition. Really understands the attack zone and has a good feel, much like Patrick Sharp, where, he plays off the defenders, as opposed to taking all of them on. His quickness makes him very effective near the goal line and wins and hold pucks. good on the wall and makes great use of the boards to advance the play. By no stretch timid but will need to get stronger as the competition in college hockey ramps up. Long term possible with nice skill/compete package.
