Under-rated bottom nine wing player with size, skill, and tenacity.  Gives 100% effort  in all phases. A linch pail player who doesn't get cute. Go after his teammate and see how he responds.  He also will draw the opposition into the box as they respond to his hard hits, strong forecheck, and aggression in puck battles. May never be a huge offensive talent but most certainly does all the right stuff to eventually contribute on an NHL roster.
