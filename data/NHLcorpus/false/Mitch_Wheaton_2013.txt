Big stay-at-home defenseman who chose the Rockets over many U.S. University scholarships he was offered. Wants to be a hockey player and will work hard and improving all parts of his game. Already over 225 pounds. Big, but docile. He gets picked apart and skaters blow by him, because he hasn't perfected his turns and hasn't even caught up to the WHL speed.
