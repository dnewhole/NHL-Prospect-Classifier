One of the younger players available, he has proven to be a solid contributer in the offensive game in and out, besides managing to rile the opposition with his feistiness. He possesses a strong heavy shot, and acts as a distrurber in the attack zone, with the opposition taking notice of where he is. He hits hard and often. Blocks shots. Didn't look good in the QMJHL playoffs due to his long list of bad penalties. Still young and working to be a complete player. A sleeper in terms of final draft ranking. He displays enough upside that his name may be called earlier than anticipated.
