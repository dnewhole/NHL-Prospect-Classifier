Youngest player in the draft as his birthday is the cut-off mark. He is a good two-way centre with surprising speed, good vision and a strong work ethic, and tempered physicalty. Strong on the puck and ellusive on the run, he is a smart and creative centre who has a quick shot to go with the quick motor.  Excellent agility, lightning jump and a fluid strong stride get him wherever he wants to be. Needs to get stronger.
