Strong skating high character power wing who could be a dominating player down the road. He has a really quick stick and and an excellent snap shot. High Hockey IQ, he is already a great wall player at 6 foot 3, 190. His all-around skill level is well above average and he shoots the puck, passes the puck, and chases the puck like a future NHLer. Displays excellent ability when in tight on goalmouth flurries. Needs a bit more development time, but is a fine long term prospect. He was selected to the roster for the World Junior Under-18 Tournament in April. Committed to the University of Minnesota.
