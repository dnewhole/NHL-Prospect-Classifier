A raw-boned rearguard who will need to get stronger, but exhibits natural ability and great North-South-East-West feet that aid in his defensive game. He thinks defense first and closes down on attackers and displays an aggressive nature in all three zones. His offensive side is developing. He can skate it out and can make the outlet pass under pressure. Needs work on PP skills but is an intriguing prospect.
