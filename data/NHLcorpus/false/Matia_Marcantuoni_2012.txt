Explosive player with great lateral agility and a hidden gear. A fine forechecking center that can close down on opposing players before they know the puck has been turned over. His hands and skills give him plenty of opportunities to show he can work the puck at top speed. Has the ability to use his skills at high speed, but his diagnosing skills of where he should lead the attack are a work in progress. His year was marred by injuries making him a true projection, and his selection depends upon when an NHL team feels it need to call his name.
