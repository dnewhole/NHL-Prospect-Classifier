Developing effective two-way defender who goes unnoticed due to his solid error-free play. He has a quick stick and will stand up for teammates. It helps to have a Father who was an Edmonton great. He needs to get stronger in the legs but has shown he can handle defensive coverage, control gaps, and safely outlet the puck. Another work in progress who may be a gem.
