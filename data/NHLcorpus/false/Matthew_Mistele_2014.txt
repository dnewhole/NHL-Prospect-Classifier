A sniper pure and simple. Skates really well and balanced, gains separation, and always gets open and ready to fire his array of terrific shots. Displays a great feel in the offensive zone and his hands help provide even more room for him.  Very coachable and mature, he needs more strength and time to develop as an all-around two-way player. Has room to fill out, and hopefully gain a bit more edge. Showed up for the playoffs.
