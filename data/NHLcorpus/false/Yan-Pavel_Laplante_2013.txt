Thick centreman whose gifts of girth, wheels, and skill project him as an aggressive power player at a future date. Plays in traffic and is unafraid of setting up in front. Is quick enough to beat junior defenders one on one. Plays like a grinder with a high compete level, and is good on the forecheck. An effective wall player. His junior team, P.E.I., often asks him to shoulder the load. On the radar as a power forward prospect, because he finishes checks, goes and back-checks on dee, and is plenty shifty when he has the puck.  He was selected to the roster for the World Junior Under-18 Tournament in April.
