Solid two way defender who never looks out of position and plays a smart game. He will need weight training, but already has excellent skating abilities and balance. Is an above average PP general, who knows where to distribute. Moves effortlessly along the blue line laterally, which helps to open the scoring lanes. An excellent long term prospect and value in the later rounds of this draft.
