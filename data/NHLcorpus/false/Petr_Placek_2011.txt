Czech import who is a high schooler in the United States with big time size and shot. Scouts expected him to blossom against the smaller high schoolers and dominate in not only puck battles, but with advanced impact scoring.  His year saw injuries and a strong offensive game that has not reached a level where the opposition views him as dominant force. Would be going higher if his injury hadn't cut down the views of his soft hands and stick, and if his deadly shot had made the back of the net a bit more. Needs to add a first step to his accretion. Teams will be patient to watch if his development can take the next step at the college level.
