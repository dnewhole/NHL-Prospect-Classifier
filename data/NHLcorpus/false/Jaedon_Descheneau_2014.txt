Fireplug who uses his solid frame to play like a much bigger forward.  Has soft hands, above average hockey IQ, and pistons that don't stop moving, working hard to pressure down low.  His shot and awareness game in and out show that he is that rare bird that can defy odds and continue up the ladder to the big leagues. Might take a few too many shots from the perimeter, but isn't afraid of the battle areas.
