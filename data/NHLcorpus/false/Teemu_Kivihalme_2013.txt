His all-around skill set and abilities project him as an excellent long-term developmental defenseman. Not flashy, but all around effective in all phases. e plays with a high compete level and physicality you expect from much bigger defenders. Four direction mobility guy who shows as much aggression on dee as he does jump in transition. He is a good shooter too. Has excellent speed and mobility and closes gaps very well. Solid in his end, where he will work the wall hard. Has a good wide frame with room to fill it in. His smooth skating combined with good stick-handling and passing ability provide him with the tools to work the transition.  Commited to Colorado College.
