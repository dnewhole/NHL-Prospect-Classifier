I have my prejudices and never EVER thought I would even consider a guy his size as a first rounder, but there is no way he doesn't belong in consideration based on his on-ice performances. Simply the best all around skilled guy in the draft. Fearless, tough, a lightning shot, and super quick hands and feet. He is too fierce a competitor to think his size will stop him. It is what it is. The question remains: which NHL team has the cahones to take him here?
