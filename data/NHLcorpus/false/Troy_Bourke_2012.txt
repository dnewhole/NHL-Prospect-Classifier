Small, fearless, shifty centerman with good hockey sense and elusiveness. He makes up for his lack of size with good functional all-around strength. He plays in all situations on the power play, scoring or checking lines, or as a penalty killer. It remains to be seen if teams will call his name in early rounds due to his lack of size and limited upside.
