Not the fastest skater but is an essential part of his team's success. He is very strong and is asked to engage in the corner battles and wall work. Plays gritty every night and has the ability to score in close or from the areas near the front.  More quick than fast. A good finisher, he places the puck well with his shots. He is possibly worthy of a first round selection, if the team choosing him sees continued success, commitment, and upside in his offensive abilities. If not, you get a player who is a natural scorer, but lacks big parts to his game, thus limiting his ice-time if not corrected.
