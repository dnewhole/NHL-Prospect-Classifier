Huge stay-at-home defender who basically plays within the confines of his zone. His size allows him to close the gaps, use his stick to clog the lanes and pushes attackers to the outside. Skates well laterally. Needs to play much more aggressively, and his skating must catch up to his growth.  Fluid for a big man and if he grows a bit of a mean streak, the team selects him gets a big, nasty defense-first defender.
