3rd year eligible player, son of Bob Woods former Hershey Bears head coach, went undrafted due to a broken left femur. His rehab was lengthy. Attended Capitals pre-season camp, where his father serves as an assistant coach. He continues to improve foot speed and leg strength. He shoots the puck well, and finds the open spaces to set up. Works the wall and dirty areas. Once moving, he is a load. Short space quickness is the area in need of improvement. Good sized package with considerable upside long term.
