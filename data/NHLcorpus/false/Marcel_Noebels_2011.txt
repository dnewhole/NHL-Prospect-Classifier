2010 eligible German import who does not display a lot of jump, but certainly gets there and does work the offensive zone well. He sees the ice well, and has a lot of skill and smarts. His wide body makes him dangerous as he goes to the net. He sees the ice well and is an effective jam player in deep. Huge forward with a good dangle and the potential to be an NHL forward. Shows agility but is raw due and needs time to get stronger, fill-in and get a bit more coordinated, balanced, and hungry.
