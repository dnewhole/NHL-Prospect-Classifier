Strong skating big man who is very well co-ordinated at a younger age. He seems naturally balanced and smooth in his stride, and able to control the gaps due to his lateral skating prowess. Also has a long reach, and smarts. Wins collisions against most opposing players. Good skill package and a huge upside, that is if we can use his showing in the OHL as a starting point in the long road to the NHL. So far he keeps it simple, being more of a decent outlet pass guy, but has puck skills enough to carry the mail.
