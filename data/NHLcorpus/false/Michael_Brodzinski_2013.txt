Both of his parents have played the game. At this point, he is under 6 foot, but growing. Has a huge shot. Possesses speed, agility, and soft hands and uses his gifts to play a simple but solid game. Good skater who will need work as adjust to the speed of the higher levels of play, he nonetheless likes the puck and jumping into the play. Plays tough, and when he plays under control, is an effective defender. Committed to the University of Minnesota.
