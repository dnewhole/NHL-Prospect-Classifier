Smart defender whose good feet allow him to play solid in his own zone, with good gap control and aggression. He is a good skater, strong with the puck, and has upside as an offensive contributor. He is an opponent who is difficult to play against as he plays hard and nasty. Isn't really an upside offensive type.
