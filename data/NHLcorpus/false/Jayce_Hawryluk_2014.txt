High-skilled winger with a solid three zone game. Displays good speed and keeps moving to stay in the play in all three zones. His skating is strong and well balanced, and he plays strong on the biscuit, and protects it as he tries to create scoring opportunities. Reads and gets open. Shows some snarl and grit. Responsible and in position in his end. Size at this point may be a concern.
