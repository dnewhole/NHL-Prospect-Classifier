Enigmatic speedy winger who teases with spurts of advanced abilities. Although not a polished scorer, backchecker, or energy player, he does at times show intensity and drive that seems missing if you watch him for a couple games in a row. Likes attacking and plays interested, even gritty down low, but turns it on/off. Can the switch stay on?
