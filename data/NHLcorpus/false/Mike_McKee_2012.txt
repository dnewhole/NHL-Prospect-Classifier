Until two and half seasons ago, was playing forward. The switch happened at a good time because he was just growing and developing his feet and agility. He already had a pretty good skill-set for a big guy, good hands and a good shot. He needs to put much more development in learning the defensive position, and although NHL teams may be projecting him as an energy forward type, it might be in his interest to concentrate on learning to be a defender, as his long term value would increase.
