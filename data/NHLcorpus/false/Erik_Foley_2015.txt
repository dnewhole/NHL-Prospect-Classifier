Another quality US-born prospects who is an excellent forechecker, and fearless "take it to 'em" forward. A good passer and emerging offensive skills. Has gotten physically bigger and added some girth.  Don't believe those who think he cannot handle the rough going; he is very good in the battle areas and on the wall. It is just a matter of growing his entire game a bit more and committing to Providence College will give him the time to develop both his physical and hockey side.
