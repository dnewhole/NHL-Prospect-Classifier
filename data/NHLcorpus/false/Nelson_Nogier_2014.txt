Big defender who is a strong balanced skater with good mobility, and excellent defensive awareness. Takes good angles and close well, and use his active stick well to break things up. Keeps his goalies sight lines open by clearing attackers out. At this juncture it appears he has many of the tools to be a solid shut down defender with a possible payoff down the line as a player with some offensive side to his game. Has the size and frame to fill out even bigger. A smart defenseman who reads and reacts with calm demeanor. Uses his stick to break up plays and stop advances. His great mobility allows him to close down on attackers, move laterally to force attackers to the outside and handle one on ones. Clears the front. Much to like in this developing player.
