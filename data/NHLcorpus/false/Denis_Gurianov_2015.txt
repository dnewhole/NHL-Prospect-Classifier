Pro-style wing whose powerful legs get him to the front. Has shown his superiority, starting in the Five Nations Tourney, by making plays and taking shots while completely covered due to the size and hands. Terrific heavy shot and quick release. Strong board player and and on the cycle. Plays a 200 foot game with strong defensive commitment. Potentially a top end pro-style wing prospect who gets most boxes checked in terms of size, skill, skating, hockey sense, hands and power. His powerful stride makes him almost unstoppable as he goes were he pleases and can release his cannon shots while defenders attempt to drape themselves on him. Strong three zone player who is very responsible on the back check. Owns the wall and his powerful stride lets him bull his way towards the net and unleash the puck while in full-flight. Was the biggest standout in the World Junior A Challenge were he was dangerous on most of his shifts. There is always a question with the Russian prospects who havenâ€™t committed to coming over to North American. Are they willing, will they adjust to the culture/language, or feel more comfortable to stay home?
