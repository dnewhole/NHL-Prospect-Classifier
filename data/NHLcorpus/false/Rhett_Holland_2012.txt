Solid defender who shows all the tools to continue his progression as a solid defenseman. May not have the flash & dash of many of the D-men who will be picked early, but he is a workhorse at a lower tier who has benefitted by big minutes. Calm and solid in his own end, due to his feel and extremely good positioning. Closes gaps and uses his quick stick and makes life difficult for the attackers down low. Decent mobility for a bigger man. Very good breakout passer who has a good stretch pass. Logs minute on the PP.  His offensive game at this point is based on his passing, as his shot is below average. Named to the Canada West roster for the 2011 World Junior 'A' Challenge, and tried to set the tempo with hard hits in each game.
