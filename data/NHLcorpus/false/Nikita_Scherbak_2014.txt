Virtual unknown, who came over to the WHL via the import draft without high importance or consideration by the higher ups in his Native Russian, where he had never considered as a player for their international competition teams.  A tall and bigger framed forward, far from a finished product, but one that moves well, has a good stick, and good touch,and displays high IQ offensive attack savvy. True top end puck skills, and outstanding touch as he passes the puck. Shows a willingness to get to the front and has no anxiety in the battle zones. Raw sleeper who may catch the eye of an NHL team fairly early.
