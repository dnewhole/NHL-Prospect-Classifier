Super sleeper defensive prospect currently six two and growing. Displays strong reads and sense what is unfolding and reacts. At this point has very little offensive game, but that may come since he has excellent vision. Decisively responds to attacks with strong wall work, jam, and break-ups that he quickly turns in transition offensive chances. Loves to take the body on attackers and is very aggressive at middle zone pass break-ups and has a very high panic threshold and keeps himself in motion to stay in play. Makes things look easy by skating to the right places and executing. How offensive side is what identifies him as long term developmental project. Comes from large framed family. He has committed to St. Cloud State.
