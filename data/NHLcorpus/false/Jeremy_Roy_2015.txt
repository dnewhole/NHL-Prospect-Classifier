Elite skating defender who is compact-sized but whose offensive prowess and skating burst is giant-sized. An aggressive attacker who also uses his acceleration, powerful leg drive,  and stick to get back in position after the puck goes back in transition. He plays fairly physical and handles attackers and the front and has decent gap control and stays with attackers. His true strength is his as a dynamic attacker and puck carrier who understands the tempo and can slow down the play but also feels in an instant that window to aggressively explode the zone with either an aggressive pass or even by going straight into the slot and letting the puck fly. Very solid puck handler who is strong on his carries but also precision-like in his outlets and set-ups.
