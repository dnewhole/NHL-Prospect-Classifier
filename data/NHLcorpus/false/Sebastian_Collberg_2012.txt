Shifty game-breaking winger with a superior high-end gear that enables him to drive the net with power, but does so in spurts and may not be the effortless skater he was thought to be. He has a quick release, soft hands, quick feet, excellent passing skills, and a fearless demeanor. He consistently gives defensemen trouble with his speed moves and determination. His development is a matter of getting stronger and more prepared for the pro game.
