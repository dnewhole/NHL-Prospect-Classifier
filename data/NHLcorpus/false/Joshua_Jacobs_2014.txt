A promising two way defender with size and presence. Already displays pro-like decisions and coolness. Has a long reach, and is already functionally strong. Can be the first man due to his smooth powerful quickness and puck carrying abilities. Can really let the puck go. The bonsus is he is difficult to go around on dee, and is a punishing checker whose balance lets him stay in the play after a devastating hit. Much to like about him. Was named to the U.S. World Junior A roster for the Junior A Challenge.
