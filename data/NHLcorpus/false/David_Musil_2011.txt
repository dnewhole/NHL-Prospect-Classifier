Burgeoning prospect whose hockey resume is filled with high Hockey IQ marks. Has all the tools and qualities you look for in a big defenseman. Besides being able to separate attackers from the biscuit, he has above average skating steps and hands that may someday establish him as a fine two-way defenseman. Right now his biggest attribute is that he is an excellent box-out defender whose small area quickness in hands and feet can contain and strip attackers. Although he has the above-average balance and strength, he has little up-ice foot speed when he starts out, and that might very well hurt where he gets picked. Once going, he can carry the mail, and is a good outlet passer. Upside is always part of projecting defenseman and it surely doesn't hurt that his father was an NHL vet. The finished product may be a superior talent. He shows that he can effectively continue to use his body and skate to neutralize attackers, and only time will tell us if this kid can become an offensive force also.
