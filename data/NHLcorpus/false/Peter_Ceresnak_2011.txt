Physical hard hitting stay-at-home defender, who has a hard point shot. Makes a nice first pass, and even more importantly is a terrific wall player. His game needs improving at both ends, as does his foot speed. More of a North-South skater but is improving laterally. He has good balance, but he needs work to become a better thinker in his own end, and maybe develop his attacking skills.
