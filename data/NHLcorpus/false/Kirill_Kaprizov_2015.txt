Undersized fireplug of a wing who was the number one selection in the 2014 KHL draft for Metallurg Novokuznetsk. Quick and agile with great edging, he finds the soft spot and quickly release his shot while at top speed. Good vision and awareness but he must get stronger and bigger to handle the bigger bodies that will be in his way.
