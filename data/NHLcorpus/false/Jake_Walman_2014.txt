Long term blue line prospect who started as a solid skating centreman who was moved to defense, where he plays tough in his own end, and displays excellent up-ice attack instincts. Has size and uses it Excells as a PP pointman due to his shot. Not really a mail carrier, and far from ready but an intriguing prospect. Played for the Team Canada East at the World Junior A Challenge in Nova Scotia. Committed to Providence College.
