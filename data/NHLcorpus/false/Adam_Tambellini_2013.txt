All-around quality prospect with good feet, a great shot, and all-around game. Is growing bigger and stronger. He plays strong on the puck, and in the battle areas and never takes a shift off. Creates space and finds his way to the open spots. Has really good reach and projects as a wing if centre doesn't work out. Still needs time and hasn't played with top competition, but displays many fine characteristics that project him as an excellent developmental wing prospect down the road.
