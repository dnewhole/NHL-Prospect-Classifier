Growing defender with good instincts and toughness. An excellent European prospect who unfortunately broke his collarbone in November 2012, just as he started to excel at showing his offensive prowess. Good four direction skater with playmaking ability.  Has a bit of edge and is a pretty good open-ice checker. His draft status may be hindered by that fact, and that he is good in all phases but hasn't really shown superiority in any one area. He was selected to the roster for the World Junior Under-18 Tournament in April.
