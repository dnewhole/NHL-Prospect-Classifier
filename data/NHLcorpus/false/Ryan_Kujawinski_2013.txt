Big centre who skates well and leads the rush. He has quickness and good skills. Can use his wheels or out-finesse defenders when in the attack zone. Seems at his best when he plays like the big man that he is with a bit of nasty. Good hockey sense. Is effective defensively and on offensive, he is terrific when forcing the issue down low. Handles the puck very well and is a good set-up man. He may end up on wing, as he is less set-up man and more shoot first guy, where he displays a lightning fast wrist shot. His offensive production this season will have strong bearing on where he ends up being selected, as he only lit the lamp 17 times.
