He was not invited to the scouting combine possibly because of his age. This undrafted 19  1/2 year old had an early injury, but eventually showed he had an offensive game to coincide with his sturdly built and super-tough play. He has been drawing comparisons to former Western Leaguer Milan Lucic. He is far from close to this comparison, but does have an untapped skill set and is an improving all-around player besides being a real fist-fighter.
