Second year eligible player who we had projected as a possible 4th rounder last year. Made significant progress as a solid offensive threat. A player with an extra gear who can leave the enemy flat-footed when he breaks up ice, and can score on a breakaway or shoot-out due to his patience and hands. Can be strong on the puck in tight quarters but seems at this point to be happy just getting open and being a perimeter player.
