Gifted scorer who has a knack for scoring. Very smart player who has a feel for the game situations and quickly makes the most of them. Whether it's crashing the front, or flying off the wall with the puck to shake things up from the middle, he is a dangerous attacker with lightning release. Lacks great size, strength and speed, but still is already an impact player in the OHL.
