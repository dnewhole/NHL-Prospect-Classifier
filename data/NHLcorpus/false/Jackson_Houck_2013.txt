Hard working two way wing with a combination of physical edge and offensive prowess. Not the most polished skater at this point, but a punishing checker, quintescentail team player who can get the puck to the open man, and even chip in a big goal. Scored 23 goals and 57 points on a rebuilding Giants club that only won 21 games.
