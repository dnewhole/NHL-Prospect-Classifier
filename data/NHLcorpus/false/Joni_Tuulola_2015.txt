Lanky second year eligible two-way defenseman with a calm demeanor and lots of likable qualities. he was noticeable at the World Junior Under-18, where he made effective plays at both ends. An excellent passer out of his zone and good puck handling ability. Has good feet but needs lower body strength that will make him quicker and more agile. Still an empty canvass in parts of his development but already has a high hockey IQ,plays smart, and just needs to grow his game and body a bit more.
