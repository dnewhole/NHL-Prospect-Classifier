Prototypical big center prospect with a heavy shot. Bruiser who commands respect and makes room for his teammates. Good wall warrior and very responsible defensively. Decent hands but his offensive game is a work in progress. Hasn't shown feel for the attack zone yet, except for when he moves to the front, where he poses problems. Hard worker whose skating acceleration and agility need improvement as well as his offensive vision and implementation.
