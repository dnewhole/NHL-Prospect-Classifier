Butterfly goalie with a quick glove and strong athletic ability. Has quick reflexes, fast legs, good lateral movement, solid rebound control, good positioning, and great recovery ability. Calm when the attack is strong and drives when taking shooters on. Very lean and had no formal goaltending coach until four seasons ago. Intriguing goalie prospect.
