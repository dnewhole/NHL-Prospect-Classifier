Rangy, physically mature defender who is defense-first, but also shoots and passes well enough to get PP time. Uses his body to punish attackers, and pretty much maintains good positioning in the defensive zone. Has some offensive game and a big shot. He plays in all situations and looks like a good developing prospect.
