Big wing who plays strong and fast. Has a powerful long stride and can carry defenders when crashing down low. Plays strong on the puck, with good hands and scoring smarts. Strong hard competitor who wins in the battle zones, wall, and behind the net. Always keeps his feet moving and makes chances for himself. Also displays good East-West lateral ability. Much to like in this developing wing. Was named to the U.S. World Junior A roster for the Junior A Challenge.
