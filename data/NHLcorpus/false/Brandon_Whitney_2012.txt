Brandon is a large, athletic goaltender who covers a large portion of the net. He will need to polish his positioning, but with his raw talent and size, he should be a fast riser in the rankings. Playing for Atlantic at the World Under-17 Hockey Challenge, he stared as Team Atlantic upset Team West in the fifth place game and outplayed top goaltending prospect from the QMJHL, Francois Tremblay.
