Crisp tape to tape passer who can carry the mail, but also show a whole lot of grit. Made a surprisingly flawless adjustment to the WHL after playing midget last year. Reads and processes the attack and closes down gaps efficiently. Crisply hits the outlets in transition or has no qualms in bringing it out if the situation exists. Has an exceptional feel for to pass and shoot in attack zone for a first year player. Sure his bow-legged stride needs work and his frame needs filling out, but there is clearly lots to like about the way he plays at this early juncture!
