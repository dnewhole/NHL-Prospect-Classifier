Promising offensive prospect who has shown he is a puck magnet, based on all of the hard work he does to cause turnovers. His good balance, good size, and good speed let him emerge from nowhere to find a puck on his stick or put himself in position to take one away.  Center with a powerful stride, excellent speed once he's moving, and a strong heavy shot. Plays with some bite and has elite stick skills. Is more man than boy in terms of body sculpt, and has upside potential. Emerging player who may rise up draft lists by June.
