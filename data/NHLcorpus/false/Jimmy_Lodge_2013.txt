Big skilled wing who is still growing into his body. He is very thin, but has plenty of room for added muscle and girth. A smart on-ice player who lines up at left wing, but also likes to attack from the right circle in. Long term pick who has considerable upside, due to his speed, quickness, scoring ability, soft hands and good vision. He has long term potential to round out as a gritty player with a developing skills package.
