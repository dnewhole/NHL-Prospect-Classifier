In the draft year where so many defenseman were already projected to be solid NHL mainstays, comes a player who equals many of the D-men all slotted before him. He reads situations very well, and is consistently efficient as a reliable shut-down defender. Not a guy who stands out with flash or dash. Just a smart player who stays within his abilities to be a very good two-way defenseman. Has nice size and a wide skating base. Not overly physical but puts himself in good position and has an active stick to break up offensive flurries. Terrific footwork. Never does too much, and plays with an ability to know when to slow things down or speed things up. A good outlet passer who never wilts when pressured and a nice point man on offense. Plays strong on his skates, moves well laterally on the blue line, and is a decent set up man. Needs to use his big-time shot more. Has many attributes that will be attractive to NHL teams as he has upside. At the CHL Prospects game, he won the event tiebreaker as the player wtih the most accurate shot, edging out Scott Laughton.
