424,0,2019,Nando_Eggenberger,"Big and strong Swiss wing who is a deceptively strong and quick attacker. Appears in close whenever he chooses to do so. Already stronger than most in his Swiss league, he creates chances along the wall and down low. He has a sniper's hands from the perimeter and hockey sense to find the open areas. This big horse gallops in from nowhere and lets it go with an offensive stampede. or swings out from behind the goal line. Prototypical power wing with size, shot, balance, and nice North-South skating ability. Not pretty, just effective. Plays on special teams with success and has a great defensive presence at both ends. Wins puck battle on the wall and in the corners. Has a goal scorers touch and is very difficult to move off the puck. A solid penalty-killer who diagnoses well. It was a revelation a year and half ago in the World Junior Under-20 where he took on the role of a power winger. Made the transition to the North Americia in the OHL and has continued to show his value in that role. Unselfish and makes positive things happen when he is carrying.",TBD
425,0,2019,Ethan_Keppen,"Projects as power forward who uses his body along the wall, in front and down low. Displays a very strong stride and first couple steps. Will slide to the front and be a moving screen as his team sets for a shot, and spread and anchor looking for the deflection. After winning pucks in the greasy areas, gets loose and he lets loose a heavy accurate shot. More than willing to fight for lost pucks and plays hard away from the puck.",TBD

Already understands his position and displays good feet, defensive recognition and the calm ability to make defensive plays.  Has a very good back pedal and an excellent pivot. Solid in the middle zone and closes down the space on attackers before they get a head of steam. Not afraid to take responsibility with the puck in his end find a way to slip out of the zone whether it is a smart pass or a carry. He is a good skater who quickly gets going in his starts from stops. Opens his hips and lets the puck fly from the point. Russian backline import who has a nice two-way game, good functional strength and powerful four direction skater. Started the year missing games due to injury, but came back to nicely transition back in and there are glimpses of some real offensive potential there.Far from the finished product, there are many questionable instances that he still lacks sound decision-making skills or that he is not yet reading the ice well. He has big frame and pins players to the wall, and has time to grow his game.",TBD

Has skills but may need a bit more time to steady them and adjust to the higher speed of the advanced levels he will be graduating into.

Thought of as a gifted guy with smart instincts, with good energy and stick skills, but that might be a premature assessment. At the Five Nations Under-18 his zone entries were thwarted on zone entires with puck losses. Was given first line responsibilities but neglected his defensive end responsibilities after he was stifled on the attack. Took a needless kneeing penalty against Russia a got a one game suspension. All this doesn’t close the book on him, just points to a need for more maturity in his on ice demeanor and in his game and skill development.",TBD

Goal scoring winger with a high IQ, who finds the soft areas and coverage and ends up getting some nice looks. Very strong and can bull over defenders and strong on the cycle creating looks when he moves out from the corner.

The chinks in the armor started showing up when he started getting lost in coverage and unable to contend with the the bigger players in International play. In the World Junior he looked out of place in that he didn’t seem to be able to pivot along with the attackers so they blew by him.

443,0,2019,Matej_Blümel,"Second year eligible player who surprisingly was not selected last year. ""The most impressive Czech player in the Five Nations U-18. a year ago. He is an explosive skater who needed time to adjust to the new surroundings of an experienced Waterloo USHL club. Works hard to use his speed to separate, find seams, and forecheck. His shot is coming along and is a dangerous player when on the ice in short-handed situations. Committed to the University of Connecticut.""",TBD
444,0,2019,Ilya_Nikolayev,Six foot thick centreman who has a strong first step and bursts that glide him into the soft areas on the attack. Good balanced skater with a bowlegged base but it doesn’t deter him from controlling the middle of the ice in three zones responsibly. A very soft passer who is slick in his movements before he dishes. Displays fast hands and quick burst explosions as he comes out from the corners and wall.,TBD
445,0,2019,Daniil_Gutik,"Can stickhandle and move on the attack fairly well and despite average feet and agility still has some dangle to his game His primary negative is his skating which still is a work in progress.

446,0,2019,Robert_Mastrosimone,"“Maestro” is a high energy wing that plays in all situation bringing it each and every shift, and leads by example. Has excellent vision and is sneaky in the attack zone, drawing opponents and then creating looks through teammates. Plays fast, shift and with high energy and some sandpaper each shift. Displays a really quick shot, and attacks the opponents to take back pucks in defensive end, and is relentless in the defensive end back checking, lifting the puck carrier’s stick to unearth the pick. An accomplish penalty killer who is 200 foot unselfish with the puck. A deceptive skater who can lull defenders and crank his acceleration into higher gear. A lightweight, but too much to like about him to not think he gets selected and might find a way into the bigs. May not be the most diligent in all zones, or very physical, but when it comes offense, he is the fuse that lights the powder keg. Committed to Boston University.",TBD
447,0,2019,Yegor_Spiridonov,"Every viewing of this solid Russian centreman had been positive even though he is not considered a big time impact prospect, just a physical one who takes care of business efficiently one at both ends of the ice, with a technically sound and responsible game while the marquee guys gets the glory. He is always there to lend a hand to his defenders and is tall and a rangy skating style that allows him to carry and eat up ice. He is rugged and takes hit to make plays, will hold the biscuit that extra second to freeze defenders and allow teammates to fill the soft areas. A tenacious penalty-killer, he has yet to show strong offensive upside. If this player was part of a North American program he would be heralded and taken a lot earlier. Lots to like as a team’s later round investment.",TBD
448,0,2019,Ilya_Mironov,"Like so many of the “Russian factor” players, he falls into the category of the prospects we can wait for and will take a chance on later in the draft. I am not sure if a team invests in his stock, since his is a bit of an enigma: a defender oozing with a load of physical tools but so far is showing little growth in his understanding of what playing defense entails. He is a long term developmental prospect who will be called upon to start growing at his position.",TBD
449,0,2019,Samuel_Fagemo,"After a strong summer at the Ivan Hlinka tourney, injuries beset this quick winger. Although he a good come-back scoring 19 goals and 30 points in 37 SuperElite games for Frölunda he also potted 5 goals in 5 playoff games.  A scorer with a quick release and strong shot. That has resulted in less team-orientated attack when he  is on the sheet. With him  putting blinders onto his options and taking low percentage shots that result in possession changes. I understand the scorer mentality but he takes it a bit too far.  Takes many shots from outside the perimeter as if he doesn't yet understand or care about the idea of working the puck down in. Improving Swedish winger who has developed through the luxury of playing with quality line mates. Under six foot, but thick,  he sees time on the power play and had started to develop a strong 200 foot game. He’s have a bit of sniper in him, as his quick release is pretty accurate. Will receive a pass and let it fly on net in one motion. Deft passer who can saucer it to his teammates in flight. Good development project at wing. There is enough talent to think he will get chosen while teams try and patiently hone his hockey IQ.",TBD
450,0,2019,Michal_Teplý,"Big off-hand left winger with soft hands, great physical attributes and an improved skating gear and footwork. Handles passes and in the Five Nations U-17, had a hat trick against the Finns. Improving as an attacker as his legs and hands are coming together. He has good vision and now is playing at a confident tempo. His co-ordination has progressed and was surprisingly physical against the Russians and applied strong forechecking pressure throughout the match. Lets go with dangerous shots through heavy traffic. Just through open ice and his solid edging helps him cut out of traffic for a good look. He is still filling his frame in.",TBD
451,0,2019,Mads_Søgaard,"Giant Danish goaler who is quite agile and flexible. Covers much of the open net and is able in a crouch, take away the bottom, then propel himself in a cross net push to the other post. Looks awkward when standing tall, but is quite athletic enough to shuffle through his positioning despite his massive upper body. Nice developmental goalie who might eventually surprise as a big leaguer.",TBD
452,0,2019,Layton_Ahac,"Long lean defender who wasn’t afforded as much situational ice time to raise him to the upper echelons of the draft class, but he shows terrific feet,  nice jump, very good offensive talents. Reads the ice and sees those hard to anticipate seam passes and pinpoints them, while in motion. Good size and athletic enough to continue to develop into a solid defender as well as a mailman. Might have the lightest edging in the class, he is a long term project that has a high water mark. Committed to Ohio State University.",TBD
453,0,2019,Albin_Grewe,"Perpetual motion fireball of a wing with non stop speed, motion and intensity. Has terrific vision, compete level and seems to always come out of the high battle areas with the puck. Leading his junior team scoring by virtue of his skillful hands, his moves, and his abiilty to make successful passes in high traffic areas. His strong push on his wheels get him past defenders like he is bulling his way where he wants. Always moving in his low to ice stance, he dekes you, and makes time to thread the puck to an open teammate. Players like this are a nightmare to defend, and he still will score when double-covered. Displays a lightning-fast release. One of the best forwards in the Under-18 Five Nations tourney on a team filled with older players from the 2018 class.",TBD
454,0,2019,Daniil_Misyul,"Tall lean attacking defenseman who is fluid on his pins, very patience and fearless in his carries down low. Fits in the definition of a new age attacker who picks his spots and activates into the mix, looking at the best option while carrying strong with puck, causing coverage problems while keeps moving before passing or shooting. Displays a hard point shot, solid set-ups and smart offensive vision and activation. I am sure there are negatives we can cobble from his defensive end work, but is difficult to not be excited at the the prospect’s playmaking and scoring abilities. The cherry on top the cake is he is more than willing to drop the gloves and has a strong right hand too. Did I say he is still playing in Russia?",TBD
455,0,2019,Colten_Ellis,"Technically sound goaler who plays calm and collected and excellent flexibility. Smooth handles his movements up and down and sideways with control. Absorbs shots, and re-sets quickly. Rebound control and redirection is a work in progress. Thrives on being the man in big games. His behind the puck handling is an area he will work to improve on.",TBD
456,0,2019,Simon_Holmström,"So far he has had an injury-riddle past that probably has set him back in his development. Projects as a two-way winger capable of sliding over and playing some centre. High on ice IQ, reading the situations and reacting in all three zones. Displays a high skill level and creativity and does so many things well with really good jump with or without the biscuit. Plays in all situations and is counted on at the games end to help hold the lead. Breaks up attacks and quickly initiates the transition counter strikes. Will take possession and go end to end, beat a defender wide and drop the leg to split the defenders into the middle. Hasn’t shown he is an overly physical player, but that may be due to his post injury anxieties. This youngster will get plenty of scrutiny and might surprise by going off the draft board a whole lot earlier than expected.",TBD
457,0,2019,Ryan_Johnson,"Lightweight mobile new age attacking defenseman with good upside due to his mobility, puck carrying skills and over all awareness. Excellent in transition with the outlet pass or my carrying the mail. His high end footwork allows him to be aggressive defensively with the confidence in his lateral agility to get back in the mix. In the World Junior Challenge, he acted as a shadow who mirrored the movements of Podkolzin. Needs to get better in his diagnosis and reaction in his end so he isn’t running around so much, but his feet with eventually settle down and slow the game down. Very good at joining the rush down low, but is careful not to get caught. His long fast strides point to his upside. Almost looks as though he uses the boards to secure the time and space to suddenly explode out at top gear in a series of cuts to surprise and catch teams flat footed. There is lots of upside in this youngster who needs a bit more development and weight room work.",TBD
458,0,2019,Oleg_Zaitsev,"Big import Centre-wing with good size and powerful stride who plays strong on the puck. A very good small area passer and is committed to a 200 foot game player with really excellent North-South quickness. Very skilled with good anticipation, and good offensive instincts. He has been able to slide up and down the Red Deer lines and fill in all on-ice roles and situation on the PP or PK. He tracks loose pucks and can carry them and separate himself from the opposition's traffic. Can and will take shots, but is more of a playmaker and although not an excellent lateral player, he displays good edging and reads plays well as a defender and is an agile attacker. Is strong in his arms and was a essential player in the top six while playing for Dynamo as has continued to be for Red Deer.",TBD

This skilled winger is a big riser and the team selecting him will be patiently wait for his payoff.",TBD
461,0,2019,Jordan_Spence,"Fits the push defender style well with his high end tools, mobility and power play quarterbacking prowess. Not completely polished in his own end, he is good without the puck and a smart hockey head in his own zone. Really good puck carrier with vision. Very agile and mobile but still needs to improve and get stronger if he is to progress to the highest level play. Lots to like in this development push defender.",TBD
462,0,2019,NIck_Robertson,"Lil Centre / wing with excellent feel for the puck, the eyes and quick on-ice reading of the action who starred in the CHL Prospects game setting up plays and flying each and every shift. Displays elite skills with the biscuit and can and will outmuscle the big boys for the puck. Has a deceptive fast release, and excellent accuracy. So good at surprising the opposition with rocketing passes of his stick, pivoting off the wall and placing pucks on his linemates tape for goals. Missed almost a third of the season but returned with a 27 points in 26 game pace. Relentless in puck pursuit. EVERY NHL team has room for this type of player, it is simply a matter of where one will call his name.",TBD
463,0,2019,Jackson_LaCombe,"An intriguing high school who has made the transition for being a forward to a rushing defenseman. After a growth spurt, he has now good size, wheels and offensive instincts that helped him amass 20 goals and 81 points in his 50 game season in his sophomore year of high school. A terrific skater with great stop/starts, good edge work, with good vision and up-ice mobility. A power play quarterback who reads and creates in all phases of the attack. His lack of experience at his position seems a mute point as he he shows solid understanding of defensive zone positioning and his responsibilities as a defender. Committed to the University of Minnesota, where he will continue his development.",TBD

Has all the attributes of the prototypical modern defenseman in his good feet, ability to skate pucks out of trouble with no panic. Displays good feet and light edging that aids in high transition skills. His own forwards count on his ability to successful initiate the breakouts. He will go into a tight spin elude forecheckers, confidently carry the puck using his big first step and make outlet passes with force. He will use his short bursts to secure loose pucks and navigate through traffic safely. He isn’t a gambler offensively and capitalizes only if the situations allow him to. His edging aids his work as a power play quarterback who distributes well on zone entires and while walking the blue line.",TBD

Displays excellent puck tracking, super quick leg pads and the ability to direct rebounds where he wants them. Fills the net and there is little net to shoot at. All he has done in the 2018-19 season is play for the U.S. Junior Select Team in the World Junior A Challenge, where he posted a shutout in the gold-medal game victory, lead the USHL in goals against average in this his rookie season.

Handles the puck well on his receptions and has good knee-bend, so he pivots with power in transition or after he provides a secondary outlet for his teams puck carrier out of their defensive zone.  Very good in his end and handles business inside the box area, and is very cognizant when he has to move to another man in his defensive assignment.

Has nice size and upside.",TBD

He is not the finished product and he needs to become a higher pace 60 minute player. Light on his skates and edges, he finds the soft areas and is opportunistic in tracking down rebounds, like he was built to be a greasy area scorer. His rookie WHL season is one where he has excelled with no fear failure. Will need time to round out is development, but clearly his name has been rising on draft boards.",TBD

A two-way player who never stops working at both ends, and is also able to caress the puck while in ascending to top speed in pass receptions or while he is splitting the defenders. Dynamic under-sided junior player that could see time at pivot.

A lean six footer, he most certainly seemed to have a high level of functional strength and blazing speed that aided him in dominating battles all over the sheet. Not the most gifted high end skill player, he nonetheless give great energy and created lots of scoring opportunities by carrying defenders on his back to the net, winning most board battles and thrown big hits, and driving hard to the net strong on the puck. His wide stance enabled his quick pivots to receive passes and loose pucks and drive hard on the attack. Pounces on turnovers and capitalizes. Saw little time with his top end teammates, which left me wondering what if he was surrounded by quality line mates. Worth a look.",TBD

A very agile East-West skater who has excellent jump and a very good shot. his actually skaing is average, and there may be a lack of hockey s=marts and vision, but the ability to shoot is his strength. This season with a weaker St. John team he struggled but still managed 22 goals / 46 points in 60 games, but he also was sat out when he looked like he was give less than the best when teams rolled up scores on his putrid team. I think there is enough there for some team to take a chance that there is a player they can develop.",TBD

A North-South skater who can get wide and go to the net or be a heavy rugged force in the high traffic areas, along the wall, and in the cycle. Besides being a handful for opposing defenseman, he has good hands as a scoring threat. He will a player who sets up between the circles near the blue paint and puts rebounds in the back of the net. A big centre who may project to wing has a really nice stride, first step quickness, and a smattering of skill.  Refinement of his defensive zone commitment is in order, but you can'y overlook his pro caliber release, or how well he  protects the puck. Committed to the University of Michigan.",TBD

Quickly gets to open ice and displays light edging and makes himself available for receptions, and can gain inside position and cut hard to the net. Blocks shots. Has room to put more weight on his frame and he can get quicker as get comfortable with his taller / larger size. A finisher who was third on his team in scoring with 39 Goals, 79 Assist in 68 games.

Displays good puck control and can even one hand it to get some room to move out in transition. Protects the biscuitwvery well. Does so many little things well already. Gets open as an outlet for his forwards, dominates the wall play and  his aggressive demeanor on the boards and in front of his net, wins pucks and makes impressions. He has a good feel for where and when to pinch in the offense zone, and opens up his stance to let it rip from the blue line too.

A mobile defender whose polishing his passing and zone entries in hopes of progressing to the NHL as an eventual power play Quarterback. Has displayed fearless in the defensive end, willing to block shots, or step up in the opposition as they try and gain ice.  Very aware of his positioning in his end or when he adjust into open ice going the other way. Always moving his feet and has a good short area burst to get to loose biscuits, and his stickhandling allows him room in traffic. Displays an excellent stick to break up passes, and although his creativity is just emerging, he is very good at laying precision passes on his moving in down deep in the attack zone. And his shot from the point is already coming at NHL velocity. A bit of a riverboat gambler. Still developing but may be second round consolation prize. Cool and collected and improving nicely.",TBD
476,0,2019,Nils_Höglander,"In the Four Nations Tourney, this agile whirling dervish was the bright star of a dimly lit Swedish contingent. Short and well built, he shakes off defenders and is near the puck a whole lot. Undersized wingers must contend with upward battles of consistency and confidence as they try to crave a space out in the higher levels of the game. This 185 pounder will be faced with an uphill climb but it might be early to start throwing in the towel on his chances. Very confident in his puck-handling, he is quite adept at making tough passes, and traveling the sheet at top speed and tight edging and quick stop/starts that help create separation from defenders, and attacks the weak spots in coverage. Shortens his stick even more to navigate through the highest spaces. Looked very good as a component of  Sweden’s U20 team, but his graduation to the SHL has not been an easy one partially because his Rögle club isn’t an awfully good one that surrounds him with complimentary linemates who can strengthen his game. He has a surprising one timer, and is nimble enough to drive through closed lanes and get scoring looks. I am sure he hasn’t given up and become unconfident in his abilities, but he had a very poor first season, yielding only seven goals and seven assists.

He plays with a very long stick but keeps pucks in close. A three zone player who plays smart and isn't wasting effort but letting things develop. Doesn't look like a guy who is going to going to attempt to play too physical; he will beat you by suddenly bursting and disrupting with an interception, break-up or a no long pass to a teammate.

I continue to read about how he doesn't project to a first pair defender, and to me are mute, when they same critic decides another junior player ""projects as a NHL first pair guy, and they there only basis is their junior resumes. This is an under-six foot Swedish defender with terrific speed, balance and stick and already has a two-way game and logs big minutes in the SHL. New age defender who displays high mobility and feet that don’t stop churning. His skating stride is built upon really deep knee bends that place him in a very low close to the ice skating stance. Can jump off on his edges if he’s a way through or to the puck. His hands may get a bit softer, but presently awfully good at controlling pucks when sending them away or when receiving them.

Still working on not getting caught flat-footed in transition, displaying better gap control, and reading the defensive coverages in his end, and some might question whether he has displayed high end attack skills or can play in the higher levels and have success in both ends that he has achieved in junior as he is finesse-type player; what is certain is that he currently already displays sharps edging, quick pivots, vision, excellent offemsive hockey sense, and calm composure taking care of business in his current level with solid passing skills and excellent vision.",TBD

Bursts in and by defenders and makes moves at top speed and isn’t deterred in small areas avoiding poke checks and blowing by defenders and then even placing himself on a route towards the next one, only to reach around coverage and continue the attack.

He already has seen time on left wing on the top line. Possessed top end awareness and vision and has to be also regarded as one of the elite passers in the class, and his anticipation in setting offensive looks is a thing of beauty. In spite of the depth at the centre position, don't be surprised if his name is called earlier than the mocks rank him.

Has good top speed, stick and passing ability so he never is hesitating coming out of his end and continuing to lead the attack down deep in the attack zone. His strong backward skating ability lets him transition into his back pedal and stop/start in his gaps if he wants to stand an attacker up, and he is able to shadow attackers step for step. I keep reading that he is most certainly a notch ahead of last years Boqvist, Bouchard & Dobson, based on his tool box of skills. I question if he actually is their equal in terms of hockey IQ and on ice recognition, because those strengths are what allow these players to actually play to their strengths. Regardless, a team is going to get a nice chance at a top pair power play QB and maybe a top four defender at the low end of expectations. The question is whether his skating ability helps cover up his lack of defensive recognition.",TBD

Smart, offensive, and physical on defense, he checks all the boxes as a future NHL'er who can play the fast pace and make plays in his end due to his world class skating ability. NHL team scouts that are down grading him are doing so based him not seeing big minutes with his new AIK team, as a new young buck in the pecking order, but there are definite signs of creativity on the offensive side. The same was true as the youngest defender on the Swedish World Junior U-20 team. Granted he showed chinks in his game with over-handles and longer than necessary possessions, and late read/reacts but I would warn NHL teams from dismissing his size and - skill ratios that allows him to explode on his edges and close in all directions, snuffing zone entries, funneling speedy opposing attackers, driving step for step with them, and sometimes showing a bit of edge in contact. One can imagine him being an even more consistent defensive force who finishes checks and strips pucks even more robustly. This lad gets the nuances of his position and might be one of the fastest backward burst skaters at his position. Never stops moving, has the stretch pass down, and a strong heavy low point shot, and the eagerness to apply offensive pressure down low. I see great value selecting him in the top tier of the first round, not later.",TBD

He captained the Russian Hlinka Tourney team by example. In the Bronze metal game, while on the PK, he worked the wall in his end to unearth a puck which he quickly got up ice giving his teammate a breakaway. His teammates attempt was stopped and as the USA team tried to exit their defensive end, he meets the exiting US player with contact, and the puck rolls to his teammate at the red line who advances it to him. he enters the zone near the left wall and as the US defender closes, he spins back around and fires a backhand pass to his teammate who got another chance. Always working, and has such quick hands and head.

An injury-riddled year has set him back a bit, but I wouldn’t count him out of being taken in the early part of the first round. Has great speed, an extra gear and displays strong edging. Has really good patience in his possessions, and will rile defenses into over commitment, nd then place the biscuit on a teammates stick for a shot. He will fearlessly take a hit, kills penalties, block shots and more importantly is an improving in the dot. Has built a two-way game.

Another wing-centre who is very strong on his skates and can move with above average speed while he maintains possession using his soft hands to find open line mates when he has the puck, and quickly ghost into quiet soft areas to receive returns and scoring looks. When watching a guy this big, you think he is going to get held up but he seems to keep driving effortless keeping the defenders away from the puck with his long reach and staying in motion while he supports the play. He avoids attackers with side-stepping and a quick stick. He follows the action but the action tends to follow him too. Strong in so many phases of the game already, he is always close to attackers in his end nudging close deterring their advance. Is a regular of the PK and PP. I think there is upside as a pro scorer, but many of his goals will continue to come with plays he started where he positioned himself between the circles, stick on the ice, and wasn’t stopped. He is able to read coverages, make sharp cuts, by driving into the turns. His edge work keeps him away from closing traffic, and frequently leaving him uncovered in the dirty areas. Plenty of room to imagine him as blossoming as a scorer as well as set-up guy. May project as an NHL centre.

He steers pucks through traffic and his terrific vision and edging simply get opponents scrambling and unsure where the play is going to open into a solid look. He can come to a dead stop, and watch a crowd converge on his space, and wire a puck to the open spot of net. Has a terrific shot when he uses it too. Some think he is always willing to attempt inside moves, refusing to get funneled to the periphery and his gambling style might be seen as too abrasive.

Really high end hockey sense, and full throttle involved player whose on-ice presence seems to tip the scales in his team's favor when he is out on the sheet, no matter if it is in open ice, or in tight stick cluttered scenery. Reads, reacts and anticipates and answers with precision through traffic passes and receptions while playing with a cool demeanor.

An aggressive push the pace set-up man who always is trying to get the opposition on their heels. Has the skill to wiggle and weave through traffic and make plays. He is quick and tenacious on the forecheck, pressuring opposing defenders into the bad puck decisions. He has a good shot which he releases quickly, and good touch when in close.

33,205,2016,Tyler_Soy,"When you see him on the sheet, he seems younger and thinner than everyone else. Has a really short compact stride and he keeps the feet moving the entire shift. Sees the surface well and is good at positioning himself, and anticipating the possible developing play. Is very undeveloped, and needs weight room work to make him able to compete in so many of the areas he now seems a lightweight in. If he can get stronger, he will be able to compete physcality in the areas necessary, his perimeter shot will get stronger, and he will get better in most areas. Good playmaker who needs much more weight to withstand the physicality his up tempo strong forechecking style causes. He has soft hands, is a good face-off man, and always keeps his feet in motion. Has long term upside, and already shows great hand-eye coordination, moves to the open areas in lanes, and seems to place the puck wherever he iswants it to go. Clearly the team that selects him will wait but there may be a strong payoff as he improves his physical development.",Anaheim

Relentless in puck pursuit, very similar to his father, Cliff, a former NHLer.

A battler who doesn’t seem to view himself as the smaller guy and it can hurt him. He is so surprisingly quick and has a very deceptive shot. His puck skills let him set up his linemates, and he makes sure he is in position in the defensive end. Works hard, and leads by example.

Has good scoring touch with his hard wrist shot, and is very agile. Provides nice feed and drop passes. Part of teh reason he was drafted two times before is it took him until this season to shown strong acceleration to go with his quickness, His defensive zone presence was almost almost nonexistent. Wasn't that strong on the puck with his carries or very creative or able to make passes to his teammates that show imagination. He was a nice centre-forward in the Q, but that doesn’t necessarily project him as a  pro until he improved those parts of his game.

His big stick gets in the passing lane and displays smart body placement in his end. He can take or receive a puck and quick change direction and transition the puck up-ice. He skating motions a bit stiff laterally, but there’s nor denying he can quickly get where he wants. He walks the blue line on the PP attack. Has a strong point shot but it’s accuracy and placement are areas for improvement. Simply doesn't seem to have the head to help comntribute much as an attacker.

Very strong on his stick, and great on the wall and down low. He plays against the top teams opposing lines and he is good in his own end.

He has what amounts to a terrible season on and off the ice. He was sent home in December for attitude problems and requested a trade out of Mississauga. There were rumors that his camp was trying to force a trade to one specific junior team, London. The Steelheads refused to blink, and he remains their player.

129,71,2016,Josh_Anderson,"A big defender who basically handles his end and then some.  Has a nasty streak as wide as his shoulders.

Works hard and long on the forecheck, his size not an impediment. His set of gears and good anticipation yield many opportunities and the fact that he plays fearless in the dirty areas only makes opponents respect him more. Is committed and good with the biscuit in his own end. Doesn’t possess a big frame and is going to need weight room development to up the odds of his chances to make it.

Has the size and feet to knock attackers off the puck, retrieve it, and get it going the other way. physical attributes. He is still adjusting to the smaller North American ice surfaces, but the ability to adjust with quick reactions, and attack and defend continue to improve with each game. The small attackers don’t really get away from him and he is intelligent when part of the attack.

Possibly the youngest project in the draft class. He needs more girth, strength, and skating development to be able to improve the power in his stride. Improving his feet will make the difference to whether he is really a prospect or not. There are no complaints on his commitment on the sheet, where he works so hard for sixty minutes.

Displays a really nice first step and terrific edge control. That allows him to patiently slip into seams, stop start on a dime, skate to passes, and surprise in the scoring areas. Not the fastest skater, but has a good pace every shift. Really good shooter on the move, and very good at handling the puck in small spaces. High energy motor, diagnoses, and with his compact stride - catches teams whether he shoots or makes pass that they don’t expect. His recognition of where his linemates will be and his slippery demeanor make every pound difficult to contend with.",Montreal

A dynamic tracking force on offense and aggressive forechecker who unearths pucks. Was slowed by ankle injury he incurred at the World Junior U-20. His downside is he isn’t interested in hard battles for pucks on the wall or traffic. He isn’t timid, just leery.",Calgary

Sees and anticipates developing plays. Far from ready to be considered NHL worthy, as he has zero interest in getting dirty in physical games.

A strong transition player who has excellent four direction mobility and elite straight ahead acceleration. Displays good composure and is solid in his end at the junior level and stays home until he is sure he can join in on the attack. His feet aid not only his gap control, but let him burst in and disrupt their entrances. Gets his stick out and breaks up the passing lanes in opposition attacks. He is a good outlet passer in transition, able to get out of tight spaces and can jump up and join the attack and tear through the opposition neutral zone positioning. Terrific one timer, and a no-look pass/shot that is never telegraphed. Excellent touch passer and he can barrel across the blue line, fake a shot, and glide in closer for an even better one. Can get caught down low when he activates, but I can’t think of any NHL club that will have concerns about his size or long range upside.",Los Angeles

Explosive bursts in his carries and loves to activate. Displays a precise outlet pass in transition. Is still a work in progress and a defender.

He is committed to Boston University where he can hone his game.",Chicago
195,44,2016,Boris_Katchouk,"Meat and potatoes winger whose game involves strong physical combat with opposing players, and solid forecheck, strong work ethic, a deceptively hard accurate shot, and quick feet. Strong in puck pursuit and strong on the forecheck. Actully has pretty soft hands. Maybe the difference in selecting a player with high end upside and Katchouk, is he is going already be suited for growing in to a role as a checking winger as he climbs the ladder to higher levels of play. Disruptive and aggressive in keeping possession, there is no question that he has skills, nose for the net, skating ability, edge and the willingness to be an involved player for sixty minutes.

Decisively attacks with quick shots, passes, and even uses the enemy goaler’s pads to generate rebounds. A character individual who has handled real life adversity in the lats years, as he has had to carry the heavy emotion load of family sicknesses and losses. Plays quick.

206,33,2016,Rasmus_Asplund,"Played in the 5 Nations Tourney 2014 and was a member of his homeland’s team roster for the World Junior Under-20 at Christmas 2014. Slightly built centre wing who has great hands and commitment to improving his two way game. Displays good speed, hands, and Hockey IQ.  Not the biggest body, but is strong forechecker who win puck battles. A playmaker with creativity and good vision who plays big. With William Nylander’s World Junior Tourney injury, he played in his spot. Works hard in his own end, using his body and stick in lanes to take away opportunities by getting back quickly. He sees and reads the ice well and brings his teammate support by drawing attackers his way making space for them. His anticipation,nose for the net, and good hockey sense make his a player who can slide up and down the forward lines, and that will fall in his favor when draft time calls. His size may be a factor in where he is taken. Must continue to make his linemates better plays and continue improving his 200 foot game.",Buffalo
207,32,2016,Tyler_Benson,"His Bantam and Midget resume tell of a consistent scorer/generator with a strong physical game. So far he has been asked to be an all situation player with the Giants, and hasn’t disappointed. Big bodied left wing with physicality and edginess. Displays a strong defensive game, hockey IQ, a nice skill set, and does all things at an above average levels.  And although he has a choppy stride, he is powerful and coupled with his high-end stickhandling skills and size, he fearless competes down low and in all the battle areas. Good on the cycle. An excellent passer and his precise shot and release are also high-end, although his assist totals surpass his goals. Usually the unprecise art of scout attempts to look at the entire canvass starting with the early age years and the question is asked is the prospects continuing to improve on his scoring, abilities and can he be projected as a player who will continue in improving ensuring a role on an NHL club whether it be top six or bottom six. The point is to project that you are drafting a player who eventually makes your parent club. I think that if his goal totals were a bit higher, there would be no questions that he makes the grade. I think his goal totals with continue upward and his development is far from over.",Edmonton
210,25,2016,Riley_Tufte,"An enormous wing who was the standout player in the United States All-American Prospects game. He has the skills and acceleration that you see in much smaller forwards. Has a very fast game, eg. he moves and acts at a quick pace, and his huge size makes him almost unstoppable, as he can stickhandle in smaller spaces and in a smooth motion take off on the opposition with a power move to the net. Plays hard and will stand in the crease area like an unmovable object. Is good on the entire sheet. He supports the defenseman and is known to dig pucks out of his own end. He’s a Mack truck when he wants to go to the front and has been known to carry defenders along. Certainly not the finished product and there is always the level of competition that you have to weigh against the eyeball test, but you can’t deny the dynamic combination of skill, speed, size, soft hands, reach and quick release that is there. If only he was a little more belligerent, and more difficult to play against. Committed to the University of Minnesota-Duluth.",Dallas

The younger brother of Ryan is still a work in progress, but has size and is a very good puck mover and plays on both the penalty kill and the power play. Leads by example and can move attacker out of the front,  get in the lanes and break up passes, and he make that first pass out in transition and jump into the rush. Displays a very good point shot. Will play the body, but if he added a bit more aggression, he make it more difficult to play against him. Needs to get thicker and add weight and muscle.",Washington
214,21,2016,Julien_Gauthier,"Big winger with a strong fluid with a terrific shot and release. He uses his body to take pucks away, and win possession battles in the offensive zone. A big man with soft hands, a great one-timer and a willingness to go in the dirty areas and in the front. He can change gears and surprise defenders by beating them off the wing. Q defenders get caught in denial thinking no way can a guy this big be that explosive. Needs to develop more as a play-maker, and get pucks to his linemates as well as they feed him. He is a a North-South skater who depends upon his linemates to get him the puck. His game needs rounding out, but looks like an excellent prospect.",Carolina

219,22,2016,German_Rubtsov,"Complete two-way performer with excellent size, skill and skating ability. His performance in the World Junior Challenge may have cemented his first round status. In that mid December tourney he seemed to single-handedly take apart the U.S. entry in all outcomes and all phases with his domination. Plays like it is his last game ever. Has really good size and East-West mobility which he uses in puck pursuit to get it back and get things going again. This big strong horse can force defenders backward and his ability to play strong on the puck has him holding it while teammates are able to find the soft spots. Opposing players tried to knock him off the puck but he keeps control and eventually goes to the net. If the seam closes, he with keep moving in possession until a teammate’s chance opens up. Walks out of the corners in control and hungry. Yet is difficult to project where Russian who are not playing in North America are slotted by the NHL staffs. 	Forward Denis Gurianov and goaler Ilya Samsonov went early in the first, but no other Russian went to mid-third round. It might be safe to say Rubtsov goes somewhere later than Samsonov and before the third round.",Philadelphia
230,5,2016,Olli_Juolevi,"Finnish import defenseman with a good frame and excellent offensive instincts. Displays significant upside as prospect who can eventually be a two way defender. Maintain good gaps and has an active stick. An excellent stickhandler who can be very poised with the puck. Is athletic and mobile and reads the ice well. Is a crisp long distance passer in transition and can also carry the mail out of the zone. Not adverse to going the rush, is an excellent PP QB, and has a strong hard point shot along with a long range writs shot. Very fluid and has a great feel for the offensive end. Has some physicality and will tie opponents on the wall.It is difficult to estimate exactly where he gets selected in the first round. There are plenty of reasons teams would value his vision and instinct in the attacking part of the game, but if you ask scouts which parts of junior defense’s games are most important, backward skating and handling the defensive part of the game rank rank high. He has trouble handling quicker forwards in his end, and also gets out-muscled in the dirty areas, along the wall and when in possession. He needs to get harder on the stick. These are parts of the game that can be improved upon and he does have a some bite to his game, so he is a pretty nice defensive prospect even with the parts he needs to develop.",Vancouver

Untapped offensive potential due to his hockey IQ, hands, and stick. Scored 11 goals and 35 points in the open QMJHL, so that leads me to think there is upside as an attacker too. Big solid junior defender who projects as a guy a team takes and develops. Displays good play-making ability and balance. His skating is a work in progress. He is good straight ahead, but you want more agility and better pivots in setting his gaps. As he hones his play at both ends of the ice, you would like to see a bit more physicality.",New Jersey

244,104,2018,Lenni_Killinen,"A Finnish work in progress that already has size, some girth, and some puck skills. Excellent balanced skater with blow by you acceleration and straight line speed. Difficult to impeded as he has a strong balanced stride that can barrel him through the neutral zone. An above average stickhandler who has a nice shot and can thread the needle passes on the move. He needs to make better attack zone decision with his carries and passes. Longer term project with upside who has to become more aware. Reads the on ice situations and play with more effort away from the puck, and ready when it’s time to dial it up a notch.",Carolina

247,99,2018,Slava_Demin,"A solid defensive defenseman who's offensive side is starting to blossom. Strong skater with a wide base and good pivots that allows him to take an aggressive line of defense. He closes the gap to contact. Very instinctive, smart in his reads and understanding of his position. Has an active stick always disrupting the passing lanes. Positions himself so he always seems to have leverage on the competition to take them off the biscuit. Transitions out of his end well, and also passes the puck out well. He can carry out in transition and enter the attack zone due to his wide skating base. A work in progress, but lots of good things there including one of the better skating strides backwards. Committed to Denver University.",Vegas
248,111,2018,Jachym_Kondelik,Massive Czech giant who may project to the wing. Long reach and stick that provides a big area of coverage. Has a good bit of skill. Long term developmental prospect who needs to get his movement caught up with his size. Should continue to build  more of an offensive game. Also needs to learn to better handle possession in smaller areas.,Nashville
249,95,2018,Jonathan_Gruden,High energy wing who has some upside offensively. Never takes a shift off shows a bit of elusiveness. Has an ability to ramp up a gear when attacking. Sees his options and advances the puck well. His speed makes him tough to cover in the hard areas. Committed to the University of Miami (Ohio),Ottawa
250,98,2018,Ryan_O'Reilly,"Long term project with significant skills, size and girth, but needs more playing time to see larger roles and situations.

251,94,2018,Matej_Pekar,"The USHL top rookie scorer may not be a high end speedster. He does have creativity, high end vision, a good motor, and contributes in many areas. Has a good change of direction and offensive prowess. Keeps his head on a swivel. Comes out of corners creating scoring chances with good passes and lets loose his rocket shot. Still a work in progress who needs to get better all around and stronger.",Buffalo
252,38,2016,Adam_Mascherin,"A sleeper drafted two season back by Florida. Decided to let him re-enter the draft since other NHL clubs didn't offer the second round pick they invested in his selection. He can thread a soft pass or score with his accurate heavy wrist shot. A short, thick centremen who bowls his way around the attack zone. Displays good skills in the attack zone. Not agile laterally or a blazer, he is an excellent North-South skater with speed and will push through defenders if he can find a path around. Strong on the puck in his carries. Displays excellent vision to make plays with his soft passes or his quick trigger. Needs to work on understanding defensive zone positioning. A work in progress that may not be tall but certainly is a tank.",Florida
253,97,2018,Allan_McShane,"The bar was set high when he arrived in the OHL because of the high skill levels he brought to the table. He is a 200 foot player with hockey smarts and the ability to make precise passes offensively. Good in the dot and uses his speed in the middle zone, but stalls when he gets in high traffic areas. The team that selects him will encourage a bit more tenacity in his one-on-one puck battles. He might project as a left wing.",Montreal

255,96,2018,Luke_Henman,"Skinny six foot centre good hands patience,  and good hockey IQ. Moves well both East-West and North-South, and raeds the situations on ice well.

257,86,2018,Alexander_Khovanov,"Flying a bit under the radar because the Q import was sidelined with Hepatitis C until almost January. Played slow and looked out of place during increased playoff pace. That might hurt his chances of wooing a team's scouting staff into taking him early. Takes needless penalties and didn't show much commitment, coming in out of shape. Initially looked like he might be a first rounder.",Minnesota

259,85,2018,Lukas_Dostal,"A well-balanced, well-controlled goalie with a cool and calm demeanor. Has a good glove hand, moves with balance side-to-side and up-and-down. Stares down shooters so they make the first move. Is under control and angles shots off into the corners. Reduces rebounds in the middle area. Never riled and focuses when barraged with traffic in the home plate area. Finds loose pucks before opponents do. All-in-all a good long term developmental player who needs to get a bit taller and add plenty of muscle and girth.",Anaheim
260,83,2018,Riley_Stotts,"From mites to junior, he has been one of the more heralded players as he has excelled at each level. An elite skater with a strong burst who brings it every shift. Can dominate as an attacker with his very natural quick release. Finds the open creases on the attack. Will blow in, slide stop, and then have the space to surprise with a laser.  Fires right on net with screens and his speed is problematic when he cuts in -- freezing defenders. Did I mention he's good in the corners? Gives a solid defensive effort, and sneakily grabs and leans to impede the movement of the enemy. Looked really good in the CHL Prospects game.",Toronto
261,82,2018,Bulat_Shafigullin,"Has a total of 17 KHL games under his belt and saw mostly action in the MHL and the VHL.

Already displays a strong balanced skating stride, good agility, and the ability to generate chances and score.",Los Angeles
262,79,2018,Blake_McLaughlin,"Quick and elusive puckhandler and scoring centre-forward. Very good hockey sense, excellent hands, and finish. He is among the top scorers in the USHL. At this point he is very one dimensional.  He does see some PK time but needs to build strength and an over-all 200 foot game. Needs time to add lower body strength to aid his skating. Committed to the University of Minnesota.",Anaheim
263,75,2018,Oskar_Back,"Big Swedish forward with a good two-way game, face-off ability. Good vision, handles the biscuit well and can create offense. Needs to improve balance, bursts, and skating agility, and also start using his size as an advantage. Not a high end creator as he lacks first step quickness, and lateral agility. But, he can always pull it off.",Dallas

265,77,2018,Jakub_Lauko,"Talented centre-winger who is a bit farther away from turning pro, but who displays keen offensive skills. Has superb feet and lateral agility to dart and turn defenders inside out in the attack zone. Displays solid vision and creative play-making, coupled with end to end speed. Didn’t see much playing time in World Junior U-20 but shined at the Five Nations under 18. Has really nice hands and a quick release on his snap shot. Needs to get much stronger, bulk up, and needs to be a 60 minute dominant attacker. So far, his dynamic offense shows, but seems to fade and disappear. He sometimes plays so fast that his take-ways leave his line mates in the dust behind the play. Learning to use his speed, create space, and let plays percolate are what need developing, along with upper body strength.  Not ready to absorb the physicality of the pro game, I would call him a work in progress who has to get better defensively and continue to grow his hockey awareness.",Boston
266,74,2018,Niklas_Nordgren,"Finnish full speed attacker and set up man who is under 5’ 10 and 170. Plays hard and fast with good smarts for seeing openings and capitalizing. Scored eight goals in the Under-18 World Junior Tournament, more than any other player. Displays really good hands and has the toolbox of a scorer. Has good on-ice vision and drives to the right areas to win pucks. Surprises the opposition with set ups and goals they they are unprepared for. Needs to continue to improve his feet, strength and his size.",Chicago
267,78,2018,Sampo_Ranta,"Perimeter attacker with good size, hands, shot, and skating ability. Wastes energy as a one man act instead of using his teammates to attack and get good looks.

268,72,2018,Jakub_Skarek,"Big tall goaler able to make athletic saves and absorb shots to his pads. Very flexible and active around the crease. Has the come ""up-eens"" to get behind the net to break up around-the-horn rim-arounds. Really good down low and has rebound control. Still developing and seems to lose focus after letting in a stinker or two. That will affect his entire team's emotion. At times, was the best goalie in the 2016 Ivan Hlinka Tournament and at others - was suspect. Still lots to like when you project the longer path goalies to hone their games.",NY Islanders

271,68,2018,Tyler_Madden,"Son of John Madden, he is an undersized checking line wing with good feet and 200 foot commitment. Very hard forechecker who makes chances from the turnovers he causes. Has speed that aids him on the penalty kill too. Creates space and time with solid decisions. Must get more weight and strength because he gets overpowered off the puck at times.",Vancouver
272,69,2018,Jake_Wise,"Under the radar performer who is a terrific skater with strong skill set. His year was marred by various nagging injuries. An average skater who is a good two-way player whether lined up at centre or either wing. He is smart on the ice, good in the dot, supports the puck, shows creativity in the attack. Committed to Boston University where he will hone his skills hopefully ascending to a strong third line NHL centre.",Chicago
273,64,2018,Justus_Annunen,"Big framed goaler with patience, good reads, and positioning. Moves well side to side with solid footwork, staying square to oncoming shooters. Doesn't give the opposition much to shoot at. He stays big and then can use his size and legs to take away all the lower part of the net. Needs work on his rebound control and tracking the puck better. At this point is not the greatest athletic goalie. Improving his reaction time would help, and his puck-handling. Has patience and the team that drafts him will need some too.",Colorado
274,66,2018,Cam_Hillis,"Undersized centre with skill and decent instincts in the attack zone. Long term project who needs more strength. Not very productive in the dot for a centre. He often gets taken off the puck. He seems to bolt up ice in anticipation to his team taking possession. That means he leaves his check and many times, the pass doesn't come to pass. Needs to improve to a better 200 foot game.",Montreal
275,67,2018,Alec_Regula,"Lanky defenseman with four direction skating ability, size, strength, and effective defensive zone prowess.  Maintains solid gaps, keeps his check funneled outside the middle, and is good in front at impeding attackers progress.

He does not shy away from physical play or from engaging attackers.",Arizona
277,63,2018,Jack_McBain,A big-bodied strong player who competes hard game in and game out. Relentless despite having a strong ensemble of players to provide supplementary scoring. Establishes his position using his stature and competitiveness to wins battles and space in the scoring areas. Has soft hands and scoring ability. At times his feet look really heavy and he doesn’t keep them moving. Has the strength to carry defenders with him. Is very difficult  to move him from the crease area on the power play. The skating issues may really hurt his chances because he lacks balance. Takes short strides to his skating and isn’t an accomplished skater to work these issues out in a year with an instructor. Committed to Boston College.,Minnesota
278,65,2018,Jan_Jenik,"Raw, skinny, big framed Czech wing with good vision, hand-eye co-ordination, and soft fast hands. Has a long reach and plays strong on the puck. Is quick with reacting and processing. Displays plenty of dangle with his stick-handling ability and agility. Reaches loose pucks, is quick to send the puck on to a teammate. Has good vision and some creativity as a generator along with a quick release in small areas. Needs to fill in the frame and continue his upward developmental climb.",Arizona
279,59,2018,Gabriel_Fortier,"Undersized centre-forward who plays fast and all 200 feet. Good recognition in the attack zone, and has quick-strike capability as a scorer. Plays on the penalty kill, is strong on his skates, and has good touch with the biscuit.",Tampa Bay
280,62,2018,Olivier_Rodrigue,"Still growing and filling out, the young Q goaltender is very calm and collected in his net. Positionally strong and displays solid rebound control. Quick both side-to-side and up-down as the play is about to come to him. Doesn't let traffic affect his challenging the shot. Keeps his team in games and projects as the top goalie candidate in this class in my opinion.",Edmonton
281,58,2018,Filip_Hallander,"Lean, very agile winger with excellent edging, speed, and acceleration. Might develop into a real scoring threat because he is attacks with East-West mobility and fearless net front presence. Still maturing both physically and as an all around player. He uses his get-up to capitalize on pinching defenseman and in shorthanded situations. Still a work in progress who needs better recognition and muscle to help out in his defensive zone. Looks like there is potential here which will help see his name called fairly early.",Pittsburgh
282,61,2018,Ivan_Morozov,Offensively skilled centre who stood out at the World Junior Challenge as an unselfish pass-first centremen who works very hard to play a 200 foot ice.  A larger framed guy with a long smooth  powerful stride. A pair of soft hands and playmaking ability. Not a finished product but you have to project that there is lots to like. The scoring and offensive generating will only get better as he builds a more mature offensive game.,Vegas
283,60,2018,David_Gustafsson,"No one who views him will see future star centremen or offensive scorer. That being said, they will see one of the most advanced defensive centres in the class. Good balance and feet. Not a guy with a full pallet of acceleration gears. Nor will he set up defenders to reach to him and then see him fly by. He does have a nice stride that keeps him next to his man in coverage and able to win pucks away. Effective on the penalty kill in the Five Nations tournament. So far shows decent hands and a good sense in the attack zone. But, he has displayed a strong offensive repertoire and the same intensity one on one when on the attack. Good long term potential because he thinks the game well, and plays to win.",Winnipeg
284,55,2018,Kevin_Bahl,"Huge raw defenseman with underrated puck handling and distribution skill, he plays a physical game and gets his long stick into lanes useing his reach to defend. Make a good first pass out of his end. Doesn’t readily transition to full free attacker, but has a willingness to carry the biscuit and is a good stickhandler and passer too. Supports the rush well and will get down deep too. Still a work in development, and will need to improve his shot release and accuracy. Scored two goals in the CHL Prospects game. His size and upside clearly points to him getting his name called to begin the work toward the big league.",Arizona
285,53,2018,Calen_Addison,"Study, tough, undersized defenseman with good feet, balanced skating, a long glide and light edges. Really good polished offensive game that includes good positioning, fast reactions, and good use of his stick to impede pass receptions. Wins the race to open ice pucks. Never hesitates to stand up attackers. Makes the long stretch pass and uses the side boards to chip pucks by the opposition. Is a deceptive tape to tape passer in the attack zone. Will pinch in and then pivot and make space before driving the puck further into on the attack. There is a fearless confidence to him, that smacks of future NHLer, but undersized for his position.",Pittsburgh
286,51,2018,Akil_Thomas,"Smaller than average centre-forward who plays much bigger than his size.  Displays terrific speed to dart in and out of areas and make it out with the biscuit.  Not afraid of the work in the corners, his low center of gravity makes him difficult to knock off the puck. Has very good hands and can thread the needle in holes to reach his linemates rushing into the seams. A tireless forechecker who gets his shot off without needing much room. Continues to build on his defensive game and he stays close to his man all the way back in his zone before he transitions up on the offense. Still very light and in need of more weight room work, but looks like a solid prospect due to his all-around commitment and game.",Los Angeles
287,52,2018,Sean_Durzi,"A third year eliglble defenseman prospect who had a great start. Suffered a high ankle sprain that kept him out 25 games, but still managed 15 goals and 49 points in 40 season games. Has an excellent playoff until the loaded Sault Ste Marie juggernaut beat them 4-3 in the second round. A top penalty killer and power play guy. Has developed into a top end puck mover who has confidence in his decisions. Makes his team's transition game click. Not too shabby understanding his own end either.",Toronto
288,56,2018,Jacob_Olofsson,"Younger prospect whose played big minutes for Timra in the Allsvenskan. He displays patience when handling the puck and shows some upside as an offensive generator. Strong on the puck, he makes skilled entries and is able to create time and space in the attack zone with soft passes to his linemates. Not a flashy dominant skater. He compensates with strong two-way game and plays solid in all three zones. He drives to the front fearlessly. A leader who elevates the play of the guys around him. Has good balance and hands and wins the one on one battles. Has a hard shot but looks more like a set-up guy. Still in the developmental stage, he doesn’t hurt you no matter what line or situation he is thrust into.",Montreal
289,49,2018,Kirill_Marchenko,"Tall lanky Russian winger with good feet, balance, and stride. Nice lateral agility and quick hands in his carries. Sees the ice well, and is good at putting hard passes on his teammates sticks.  A close area battler for possessions, he is a longer term project who needs more work, but shows promise in all areas.",Columbus
290,47,2018,Kody_Clark,"Son of Maple leaf legend, Wendel. May not have much lateral agility and is a basic physical grind-it-out big-hitting winger with an edge. Moves North-South with a powerful stride with good lean and is very aggressive on the forecheck. Works hard as a guy who plays between the paint. Looks to disrupt and snap rebounds. Possesses a good wrist shot, plays strong on the puck. Works hard, but only has 18 goals and 39 points to show on his resume. A long term developmental player who needs more to his game.",Washington
291,48,2018,Jonny_Tychonick,"Another of prototypical new age offense men who stands six foot and hasn’t reached 180 pounds. A riverboat-gamble wild colt who plays that high-risk-high-reward style we see potentially filling the draft’s first round. Has tremendous feet, and is very capable of end to end rushes. Can change the game with a goal or a creative feed for one. A good stickhandler and rusher and has that high-end feel on the attack. Even in tight space, can dangle through seven defenders wondering what just happened. Opens his hips and lets go one-timers on the attack. Will stray closer and closer to the scoring areas until he feels he is going to get checked. Sometimes ill-advisedly thinks he needs to be a one man show; doesn’t use his teammates, the ice, and situations to distribute the puck. He can coming up short and has left his position short of the guy supposed to be playing it. Is timid when he has to go into corners to retrieve pucks or feels footsteps. You would like to see more compete in puck battles in all areas of his defensive zone. There have to be concerns about how he progresses as the competition gets stronger, more physical, and quicker to close space around him. Committed to the University of North Dakota.",Ottawa
292,50,2018,Adam_Ginning,"Big physical defender whose skating, footwork, and pivots improved dramatically over the season. As a defender, he initiates contact, making big hits and rubs out attackers with regularity. Plays big minutes against the better opponents and on the penalty kill. His pivots have shown improvements and he gets on the back pedal tightening his gaps. After transition in his own end, he uses his partner for d-to-d pass and clears his zone effectively with solid outlet passes. Really long-armed and has soft hands with passes and receptions as he moves up ice. Effective and creative with cross ice feeds, jumps up driving the play into the attack zone. This big man reads the offensive end as smart as anyone. Arguably, was the best Swedish player in the Five Nations Tourney. There is long term potential in his selection because he is a player who showed tonnes of improvement in his footwork, and over all agility. He is taking steps in his confidence and involvement in the offensive zone. Upside is there to continue improving past being thought of as a big physical defender with a huge wingspan who handles the puck well.",Philadelphia
293,46,2018,Martin_Fehervary,"Slovak defender who has played the last four years in Sweden. A very good skater with lateral agility and a good stride. Good gap control and processing in the defensive end. Can make the home run pass from his end, and has a willingness to carry the puck out of trouble. Basically sticks to the system. A player with small point totals but the upside to elevate his offensive production as he continues to develop. Had only ten total points during the season and playoff; a workhorse earning tons of ice time. He likes the puck on his stick and has an aggressive side. Still far from a finished product who looks to challenge for a pro job in the not too distant future.",Washington
294,43,2018,Ruslan_Iskhakov,"Midget forward who was able to amass 107 points in 50 games after transferring to the Slovakia Under 18 league. A high end attacker with great vision, passing skills, and elusiveness. Needs to develop his on-ice vision and his shot.",NY Islanders

Longer term developmental prospect with upside.",Dallas
298,36,2018,Jared_McIsaac,"Another offensive defenseman with 200 foot capability. Plays solid in his own end and continues to improve as he gains strength and adjusts to the faster pace. Doesn’t get intimidated or flustered. Is willing to challenge attackers by stepping into them or funneling them outside. Played solid in the Ivan Hlinka in the summer, and continued to improve his game all season with Halifax. Has grown to almost six-one and is very mobile puck carrier at 190 pounds. Has found a nice balance of get-up-and-go and stay-back-and-defend, in this the year of the “offense man.” But still prone to forcing plays and some real issues with his lack of awareness and processing in high-pace close-quartered defensive zone situations. He is going to have to be more self aware of when pressure is about to close on him. Better vision and having his head up on a swivel before getting blind-sided or stripped.",Detroit
299,54,2018,Benoit-Olivier_Groulx,The first pick in the 2016 QMJHL draft is a big solid wing whose not afraid to get gritty. Tall and fundamentally solid in all areas. Strong skater with a nice stride. Plays with strength but truly lacks a quick first step. Understands team play and plays well no matter what line he is on -- and can get the job done. Scores mostly from inside the dots and in front. He likes to bull his way there and take the shot. Isn’t a high end attacker or speedster at this juncture. Plays mostly in a defensive role. Longer term developmental guy who teams you hope builds a stronger offensive game to go along with his defensive presence.,Anaheim
300,40,2018,Ryan_McLeod,"Mikey's Brother is about as fast on his skates as big brother. Big centre with great really good skating ability and a separation gear who creates scoring chances with his quick hands. Uses his size to own the face off circle and dominate opposing centres in many phases with his strong compete level. Strong face-off man and is a good stick-handler able to make neat passes, setting up his linemates. Plays on both the power play and the penalty kill. There are serious questions as to whether he can fill a NHL top six role because he simply hasn’t shown very much scoring prowess. He shows defensive capabilities but I would like him to have a lot more edge and push at his size. The NHL can tolerate a “finesse” big centre IF he is a scorer, but no so much if he isn’t.",Edmonton
301,35,2018,Jesse_Ylonen,"Son of Juha, who played five seasons with Phoenix and other NHL teams. A slight six foot winger with really good acceleration, agility, and top gears. Nimble in small space and can pivot to change direction, creating space in the process. Sees the ice well, and usually knows which option to hit with the puck. A work in progress. He needs to get much bigger/stronger. In doing so, he'll be less likely to get knocked off the puck, play with more jam, and have better judgement in his decisions under pressure.",Montreal
302,41,2018,Bode_Wilde,"He is over 6 foot 2 and the first thing you notice is how fast he transports himself and the puck around the sheet.  He is a good passer but you can’t help but notice he wants to hold on to the puck, come into the attack zone, and be the difference maker. He stands out on the power play or whenever his team is in attack mode. Gets a lot of power behind his heavy shot. Easily slips down to soft areas, receive pucks, and take shots between the dots -- and he loves to do it. Uses his skating ability as an asset when being a defender. Harnesses his balance and smooth stride to get there to seal attackers off to the wall, closes gaps quickly, and close soft spots by filling them. Willing to use his size to step up and into opponents, and will clear the front. He won’t seem anything but calm in his own end, even when you may think he need to be. The wild colt aspect about so many of this draft classes defenseman has been noted so much already, but this is yet another player who seems less inclined to play conservatively by holding back in transition. He wants to make the clean entry by his lonesome and is good at it! He wants to get the transitioned pucks and go back down so he can see the defending goalie's eyes -- then score. It is this all-in, I'm-gonna-win-it-for-us play. Many times it comes back and hurts his team, but there is so much to like about his abilities. Projects as a possible top 2 pairing NHLer whom you cannot deny on the carries. Takes chances to be the difference maker. There is high upside if he continues to grow his all around game. I know I would select him. Big physical blue line presence with keen two-way game and skill set. Displays big time physicality that sets the tone. A terrific skater with a booming shot. Decide to de-commit so that he might play in the OHL and maybe be a bit more desirable to NHL suitors....",NY Islanders
303,38,2018,Alexander_Romanov,"Made his North American debut in the World Junior A Challenge. Surprised with his balance, footwork, lateral agility, strong pivots, lightning release and heavy shot. Uses his body in all three zones and will step into the opposition. Leans to hold off fore-checkers while he is moving on the attack. Creative carrier and passer who anticipates offensive flow. Supports the attack in his five man unit that expects him to get low if the opportunity opens. Did I mention his fancy foot work and ability to change directions? He stops and starts and almost always make crisp outlet passes from his end.",Montreal
304,34,2018,Serron_Noel,"Giant raw wing who isn’t close to the final sum of his parts. Has been on an upward spiral all season and this 200 plus pound, six foot five right winger is still working on foot speed, but has really good agility. Displays a good stick, and is starting to realize how he can dominate with his hands and big body to handle tight space. The comparison with past Q big forward Julien Gauthier stops right here; this giant wing has quick hands and some lateral ability, that separates him significantly. His long reach coupled with his long legged fluidity let’s him cover lots of ice in a shift. Goes to the net and has physical tools that might lead him to a strong NHL career. He’s never gonna be fast, but is strong on his pins, and uses his size to create time and space with an edgy game. Continues to improve his play away from the puck, and has room to add muscle all over, which will help him improve his movement.",Florida
305,30,2018,Joe_Veleno,"He is the biggest wild card of the draft class. The first 15 year old granted exceptional status to play in the QMJHL and is in his third season in the “Q.”  Due to nagging injuries in his second season, his point totals were less than his rookie adjustment season. Draft prognosticators and his St. John Seadogs team were looking for big things this season, but he didn’t seem to be taking a qualitative jump as a dominant scorer. A change of scenery with a trade to Drummondville gave him a bit of a fresh start. Through the middle of March he still hadn’t reached the 20 goal mark but contributed more than 50 assists and has generated offense. No one can argue with his hockey IQ, sense, composure, and poise, or his commitment to being a 200 foot centre. He displays a good strong skating stride, and two step quickness at times. He’s got the size and will to compete. Reads the ice like a vet, can pass off and exchange the puck smoothly. Fearless and tough, he usually keeps an even keel -- but he's not going to be a intimidated. At this point, he's more of an offensive generator than high end scorer. The essential question is whether he has demonstrated elite level offensive skills and shooting ability to projects him as more than a complimentary offensive forward. How much of the exceptional status tag blocks honest evaluation? No matter. Whenever he comes off the board, his new team will be rewarded with “safe” player who will at very least play in the NHL.",Detroit
306,32,2018,Mattias_Samuelsson,"Big reliable defender who makes his money with simple up-ice plays and a very good job defending in his own end. This is a very large man child who is still growing. His skating is good, his balance is good and he gets plenty of power behind his point shot on the power play. His growing into his game and no one can predict the full upside as he may be a very large man. Understands what a big defender must do and continues to comply. The son of former Flyer 6’ 7 “Kjell Samuelsson, is committed to the University of Western Michigan. A big boy who plays big.",Buffalo
307,29,2018,Rasmus_Sandin,"First year import who had the luxury of spending his season on one of the strongest teams in Canadian junior hockey. Has shown he is capable in all three zones, with really good hands that aid his alluding forecheckers and in his receiving hard passes. Although not a high end skater or overly agile East to West, he shows upside as puck carrier and attacker. He is a decent skater with a good sense of awareness and understanding of his end. Though he is new to the smaller ice surface, he can make the stretch pass. Will close off the wall with his body, and isn't afraid of contact. Smart defensively, as he picks his spots, when to pressure and when not to. Good at knowing his check as the attackers keep moving in and out of areas. Confident in his game and will carry the biscuit until he finds the right pass, without get it taken away. Not the finished product, he needs to improve his edging and strides in order to be faster and add some lateral mobility. Has nice long term potential.",Toronto
308,28,2018,Nils_Lundkvist,"Sometimes it takes playing with great teammates to bring out the best in a prospect. Thats what transpired with this kid when he was surrounded by the cream of the Swedish d-man crop at the Under-18 Five Nations tournament. Very smart in his decisions, good vision and execution. There is so much to his game that translates to high levels of competition. He is confident, has very good speed, and plays with edge with big hits. Hard worker on the defensive wall and the battle areas. Has the feet to expertly jump up into the play and activate, sometimes being the entry guy. Really good hands too. Puts pucks on the sticks of the right teammate. Arguably might have played better than Adam Boqvist, Adam Ginning, and Filip Johansson, and was a revelation.",NY Rangers
309,27,2018,Nicolas_Beaudin,"New age defender with good puck movement skills, nice foot speed, good hands and a good stick. Funnels attackers to the side boards, can make the secure outlet pass in transition. Very smart in all three zones. Has a soft touch, and excellent puck skills. Defensively and offensively aware and stays on the right side of the puck. His foot speed lets him control the speed of the game making nice touch passes. He walks the blue line and uses his deceptive snap passes to provide scoring looks. Sneaks downs and makes things happen. Will need to add strength as he develops.",Chicago
310,37,2018,Jett_Woo,"Ball of fire whose injury-riddled season had him sitting as an after thought out of the first round. As first look, he was looked at as strong defensive zone guy with a nice power play presence, but upon further investigation, appears to have sleeper in the first round. At six foot and a solid 200 pounds, you quickly see an aggressive all-around defenseman who read the options for his end, escapes a strong forecheck, and targets teammates on the way out. Uses his defensive partner well when he goes ""d to d."" Probably a bit under-rated on the offensive side. A quick ""touch and pass"" player in the offensive zone who gets the puck to his own open attackers. Will pinch down along the wall much to the chagrin of the opposition, trying to gain possession. This young man, named after martial artist, displays Jet Li core strength, and relished contact in compact space. He seems the winner in each and every physical confrontation. Besides being a devastating contact player that instills enough respect that opponents try to avoid hit hits, he has a very quick stick, breaking up passes in both the neutral and defensive zones. Unheralded offensively at this juncture, he reads and finds teammates on their way to passing lanes. Displays smarts and patience when at the top of the umbrella on the power play. The season wasn't kind to him, nor were many of the evaluations, because he might have been playing hurt or ""careful"" due to his injury. This is a player who may be off the board earlier than many expect.",Vancouver
311,24,2018,Filip_Johansson,"Another of the top four Swedish blue liners that wowed at the Under-18 Five Nations Tournament. Ranks right up there with the other three in terms of effectiveness up and down the sheet. Plays a simple game but has no qualms activating in a less spectacular fashion than the others. Displays a high IQ in the defensive zone. Has quick feet in transition up ice and back down to his end, backing up the attack. Makes good breakouts and anticipates where the plays are going. Has work to do on his gap control as he gives attackers too much time and space. Has a long reach which impedes attackers and helps reach errant passes and pucks.",Minnesota
312,33,2018,Jonatan_Berggren,"Undersized winger-center with quickness, hands, and an penchant for generating offense. The best player on the Swedish team in the recent World Under-18s, he creates lots of scoring looks shift after shift. A really good stickhandler with excellent lateral agility at high speed. He is a heavy traffic player who can turn a defender  inside out, go wide and then cut in or simply keep backing him up. Gets separation with his carries and is willing to finish checks, or take a hit to make a play. Very fast when he gains possession in the corner on the attack. Displays a strong snap shot, and fast hands when setting up his linemates.",Detroit
313,31,2018,Alexander_Alexeyev,"Big Russian import who has really improved the pace at which he plays in all phases. Rangy defender with footwork, who can transport through the neutral zone in a few strides. Strong on the puck as he protects it well whenever he is in possession. Uses his size to take back pucks and disturb attackers.  Polished enough to not hold the biscuit too long, and uses his soft hands to get it tape to tape to teammates. Displays a really low heavy power play point shot, that can be targeted for deflecting. His long reach helps pull in errant pass returns, and he keeps the puck moving emblematic of the new era role of the backliners.",Washington
314,26,2018,Jacob_Bernard-Docker,"Solid defense prospect who does the little things that lead to success, without flash and dash, or an advanced offensive game.  An excellent head that goes hand in hand with excellent feet. A strong short area burst that will slip him by the initial line of defense. Catches the opposition napping with his quick cuts and knows how to effectively slow play down. Really high IQ and effectiveness in his decisions. Has a nice low shot he gets off with some mustard. Is really advanced with his gap control, angling off and mirroring of opponents in the course of their attacks. Makes solid transition passes and looks to have high-end upside as he progresses through the college ranks. Committed to the University of Notre Dame.",Ottawa
315,21,2018,Ryan_Merkley,"Outstanding push attacking defenseman with dynamic speed and agility. High end puck skills and a keen hockey IQ that lets him highlight his offensive gifts. A wild colt that doesn’t hesitate to take on entrance into the attack zone, he somewhat ignores his linemates. Confident he can stickhandle and flash though to start the attack zone looks. Part of his bronco-like behaviors spills out with an attitude that rubs many the wrong way. He has really good vision and is an offensive leader with his carries, passes, and lateral movements -- creating space in the offensive zone. Has little trouble seeing that open man at the other blue line and can thread the needle with the breakaway pass. He is physically strong and aggressive. Really good puck distributer in the attack-zone. Another of the valuable right-handed shooting defenders teams covet. The downside is (as is with so many of the undersized fast and skilled attacking defenseman): he is a liability as defenseman -- pure and simple. It’s not so much that the riverboat gambler mentality is the cause of his defensive shortcomings either. He doesn’t seem to understand coverage or read the attacking teams. He puts himself in many situations were he has to play undisciplined and garnishes unwanted penalties. The scouting staff of team drafting in that third tier range will have to watch tons of tape and decide if the good outweighs the bad. You can teach defense whereas you cannot teach the high end skills he possesses. I am sure the team that selects him will have a scheme to protect him in his end, and move forth from there. Teams must feel comfortable that he eventually starts applying team-building behaviors to his behaviors with others.",San Jose
316,25,2018,Dominik_Bokk,"German winger blessed with good size and hands. Was relegated to a smaller role and spare part on the powerful Vaxjo Lakers Champions League finalist team.  At times looks like an outstanding developmental prospect who can send the opposition reeling by going to the front and driving through traffic. Has a good hockey IQ and excellent vision. With his high end passing ability teams are viewing him as a really nice late first round option. His soft hands thread the needle with the best of them, when dishing to his linemates with intensity by way of both his forehand and backhand. When he shows inspired play in traffic between the dots, he is moving and shooting with regularity. The issue is the consistency at which he displayed these efforts. Can look disinterested and not willing to get involved for long stretches. Teams look towards the prospects that come to play sixty minutes, even if they may have less skill than many who don't play up to there potential. But teams also hope to change hearts and minds as maturity takes place. For me, this young German lad is a toss-up.",St. Louis
317,20,2018,Rasmus_Kupari,"Solid centre-wing with top end speed, a superb stride, and lateral agility. Why his name isn't being noted is puzzling as he is an aggressive knock'em-down-to-get-back-the-puck speedster who projects as an attacking left winger. His elite burst gets him in top gear very quickly and changes direction rapidly. Aggressively gets in for the forecheck, and will use his body to separate pucks from the opposition in the offensive zone. Creative in the attack zone, he makes nice feeds and is best when he has open ice to work in. Projects as a centre, but probably ends staying on the wing because he is not a high end stickhandler set up guy. Hands are quicker shooting than handling but can lose pucks in tight. Is able to cover lots of ice each shift, and does. He has an excellent shot. Needs to get better in his decision making, reads, and become a more consistent player. The fact he shuttled from Liiga, Junior A SM-liiga and Mestis and was asked to also shuttle between wing and centre didn’t help his progress. His lack of production this past year will see his draft value drop, but there is still much to like about this prospect.",Los Angeles
318,19,2018,Jay_O'Brien,"A late bloomer with good skills, feet, and high end stickhandling ability. Six foot playmaking centre with very good offensive instincts and smarts. Has good vision and sees the open teammate quickly and effectively. Has a good anchor and is strong on the puck. Has a frame that can add weight. Has a terrific stick, and despite knocks on his skating stride by others, he provides scoring chances using his speed and agility. The issue is more if you are able to get value by where he is selected. His lack of production in past years is a troubling aspect if you see him as player who is going to trend upward. As an NHLer, he'll be expected to contribute as a regular contributor offensively. Committed to Providence College.",Philadelphia
319,17,2018,Ty_Smith,"The biggest differences between this undersized, fast, and skilled offensive defender, and the players surrounding him in the rankings is that he's a left shot and is a very responsible in his own end. He already defends better than Boqvist and Hughes... despite his undersized frame. Another elite skater with terrific edge work and poise beyond his years. Needs to get thicker and stronger, but has learned to play nimble and smart against the bigger attackers. He handles the puck at a very high skill level and lights it on his stick. A tad under six foot and about 175 pounds, he manages to elevate his game and play a solid 200 foot game despite his limitations. Before February 1st he was at a point per game pace in the Dub. A character player, offensive generator, and PP QB.",New Jersey
320,22,2018,K'Andre_Miller,"Converted forward who is a large physical defense-first defender who is nearly 200 pounds. Very good in motion as a puck carrier, can shoot the puck as a point man or when he activates as part of the attack. Uses his size to and length against attackers and lets the opposition know he is there near the blue paint. Responsible in his end, makes sound decisions, a good outlet pass, but gets in trouble with his stop/starts, or when caught not moving. Passes well in all phases and reads his end well, using his teammates on the way out. Will let his big shot go while pressing in the attack zone and opens up with a hard fast one-timer.  Still learning the nuances of the backline and is quite smart at trying to do things as simple as possible at this point. As he improves his feet, he might gain more assertiveness going up ice through the middle zone with zone enrties. At this point projects as a bottom four defender. Committed to the University of Minnesota.",NY Rangers
321,15,2018,Grigori_Denisenko,"Russian playmaking winger with excellent on-ice vision, high-end hands and stick. Was the best player at the World Junior A Challenge. Projects as a high end scorer, but will need to be less generous with the puck on the attack to actually turn into a big time scorer. Is such a good precise passer and his stop/starts are so clean he gains time to diagnose which teammate should receive his pinpoint pass. He has high end dangle and deception skills, and seems to be able to take games over. At very least looks to me a cut above everyone else on the ice sheet. And this isn't a Vladimir Tarasenko; ready and willing to work on the back end, no quit when the tide is running strong against him. He isn't a 100% each shift guy and can sour you by what seems to be disinterest at times. He has got that same Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde you saw in Alexander Semin, so there is lots to consider with this prospect. The real key when selecting Russians who aren't already over in North America is they may not want to make the jump  under the rookie salary cap constraints; they can make plenty of money while staying at home and waiting until the teams that draft them are no longer subject to the entry-level contract rules. Sometimes these Russian players slip into the later parts of the selection process unless they plan to come now and stay -- no matter if they make the parent clubs right away.",Florida
322,14,2018,Joel_Farabee,"Smart three zone playmaker with an abundance of excellent characteristics and tools that point him upward as a solid NHL winger. Presently a six foot lightweight (well under 170lbs) who has high end awareness, terrific shift to shift work ethic, and simply makes plays all over the sheet. Playing against same age competition, he easily grades out as above-average. A strong balanced skater who effectively masks his skating gears. He causes opponents issues when he has the puck and on defense when he has any chance of gaining it back. When he does make things happen, he diagnoses and makes a well laid quick pass to cause sudden momentum changes the other way. His hockey IQ tips the scale in his favor, whether he is playing against a tight defensive opponent, in a fast pace back-and-forth barn stormer, or when things get chippy. A really good penalty killer, and might be on the ice during any situation. Excellent with the puck on his stick, strong and quick to find and use his options. Has a good release; as he gets stronger, I am sure his shot will get heavier. Fearless and relentless attacker, who creates time and space to advance pucks to his linemates or cut through traffic with an accurate surprise shot. Some might argue that being on the USNTDP first line with scorer Oliver Wahlstrom has help him standout, but I think that the argument also works in the opposite direction, as this kid is a non-stop offensive generator who wills wins with his high energy commitment to victory. What teams will have to do is project just where he fits in a pro line-up. Is there upside as the competition ramps up? Or does the team that selects him come away happy they are getting a NHL package, that can be a complimentary piece as opposed to dominant first line force? Committed to Boston University.",Philadelphia
324,18,2018,Liam_Foudy,"This kid will work his way up to being a solid third liner in the NHL. Where he gets selected is the big debate.  Displays great speed and balance and simply takes away time from defenders, wining most pucks. An athlete whose scoring should continue to improve. Was one of the better two-way scorers in the OHL by the end of the season.",Columbus
325,11,2018,Oliver_Wahlstrom,"Big forward is one of the premier scorers in the United States Development Team. A big bodied, fluid skating attacker who is apt at carrying the on zone entries. He finds time and space while carrying the puck and has a good wall presence. Creatively generates offense to his teammates. Is able to play all three forward position (although he hasn't been asked to play in the pivot position) and is very comfortable as an off-handed wing. Has shown high end shooting ability and has the goals to prove it. Slips into the soft areas and gets the one-timers. Has a really fine trigger, whether it is from the periphery, or when he is given looks in-closer to use his wrist shot. His speed and shot are usually the first two mentions he gets, but his vision, and creativity rank high, despite his shoot-first mentality at the amateur level.  Has been on the radar as a top U.S prospect for some time, so with that has been many views and scouts tend to see him as an established “reliable” prospect. Not some new best thing, so he may last a bit longer than expected if teams don’t see him as a top scoring centre prospect. I see him as an NHL left winger who needs to add more edge, finish checks, and provides two way play starting in your top six with decent upside towards it.",NY Islanders
326,16,2018,Martin_Kaut,"High-end skater with top end speed, separation, and skills. Uses his elite puck handling and stick skills to blow out of his defensive zone, and will back up the defenders when he quickly gets to attacking zone blueline. Lethal shooter who can target the corners, jump on the rebounds and even deflect shots from the point. Has a deceptive way of stick-handling and disguises when he releases his shots. Will use defenders as screens in the process. Very imaginative in his strategies and passes. There is much to like, but seems a bit disinterested in his own end and when his team gets behind or out-matched.",Colorado
327,13,2018,Ty_Dellandrea,"Displays excellent skill set, good size and giddy-up. Wins puck battles and is responsible in his own end. Has a strong two-way game. Moves well with deceptive quickness. Has been stuck on Flint with no help for two seasons. If the World Juniors Under-18 showed us anything, it was that he quickly meshed with different line-mates and outworked the opposition night after night. Grinds away whether it be keeping pucks alive on the offense or with dogged forechecking to turn the puck over.  Excellent vision and playmaking ability. A developing player who makes it easy for his wingers and is still blossoming as a scorer.",Dallas
328,8,2018,Adam_Boqvist,"This draft will be marked with an unprecedented number of highly sought after skilled attacking defensemen who are average or under-sized with little physicality. This player compensates for it with terrific hands and ability to push the pace, doing a decent job in his own end using his skill set. In the Swedish junior league, Boqvist showcased a nice shot, high end speed, and agility. He may very well be the top finesse and fine-edge-skating defenseman in the draft, displaying great balance and lateral mobility. He is lightning fast and has great vision. He distributes the puck unselfishly and he jumps in on the attack -- sometimes leading it. He opens up and delivers a very accurate one timer. As a slight, smaller player, he gets overtaken, losing puck battles to the bigger players. Does show good vision in both ends but it is a bigger challenge in his own end. His fast feet help negate some of his problems in the defensive zone, but it is difficult to ignore his defensive zone positioning issues. As a lightweight anchor, he needs to fill out, get stronger, and build his defensive game. Another right handed shooting mobile defenseman.",Chicago
331,5,2018,Barrett_Hayton,"Big kid who continues to show a high skill set and a dedication day-to-day to improve on his last performance. A complete player who takes pride in his 200 foot game, has high hockey IQ, and solid playmaking ability in the attack zone. He has little trouble finding and feeding his best option in the offensive zone. Plays both PK and PP. Three inches smaller than Jordan Staal -- a player he compares to nicely. There is plenty to like about him in terms of his commitment and continuing improvement. You draft him knowing he doesn’t project as a top line impact center; just a guy the coach will love because he can play in all situations and slide in anywhere in the bottom nine and make the guys around him better. Selfless, serious, high IQ guy in the offensive end, drawing more than one attacker to him, only to deceptively get the puck to an open teammate. He is a scoring threat every shift with his heavy shot, but isn’t gonna wow you. He quietly and effectively gets his job done in all three zones or with his snap shot.",Arizona
334,9,2018,Vitali_Kravtsov,"A big winger with very good straight line speed, balance, quick feet, and scoring ability. While his numbers in the KHL were nothing to take notice of, the fact that he was on the first team power play says much for how he is thought of. He still needs to make use of his linemates, understand how to use his speed as a device to set up the five man attack, and needs to keep adding strength. Plays aggressive, hard, and with grit, projecting as a power forward. A creative three zone player who was able to impose his will and be on equal footing with grown men in the KHL. He will only get stronger and more dynamic.  There certainly is enough there for teams to consider him as a highly skilled prospect that wouldn't be available late in the first...",NY Rangers
337,12,2018,Noah_Dobson,"Plays both ends of the ice very well. Has a good frame and will continue to grown into it and get bigger, and surely he will become less shy playing like a larger guy. Already better then most “Q” defenders at using his mobility, reach, stick, and to have his stick on the right side of the puck carrier. Deceptively fast and always willing to lug the biscuit up ice. Because he is bigger and his stride is so fluid, he catches you off guard with how fast he can accelerate and then surprises again when he executes at top speed. Jumps up from the blue line deep in to the attack zone and has the speed to get himself back up ice. Has a slapper he keeps low and a strong accurate wrist shot. You would like a bit more physicality and see him push attackers off the puck. While he shows he can separate players from the puck decently although, they won’t be looking to see if he is coming next shift. Has already shown enough to be considered a top half of the first round candidate, but I have concerns he might not have the elite quickness and ""head"" speed to become a top NHL impact defenseman.",NY Islanders

537,149,2017,Jarret_Tyszka,"Plays on a deep Seattle blue line with a steady, non-flashy game with good positioning. Takes the body and takes care of his end first and foremost. Displays an active stick in the lateral passing lanes and, in most phases, is rarely out of position. Makes the first pass out in transition for his team, and can stick with his check, using the body to separate them from the puck. Very calm and collected, he clears the front of his net. Only an average skater at this point, he needs to improve in that aspect. Adding more edge would increase his success to move up the ranks to the higher pro levels.",Montreal

A natural goal scorer, with great control at top speed. Can separate when going North-South and quickly go laterally East-West when it's man to man. Can place the puck to the other side with the cross-ice pass with accuracy. Good on the give and go. Has top end acceleration and great first step. Needs to use his feet as a means to grow into a 200 player. And he needs to get thicker and stronger. There is no denying he is usually the most skilled guy on the sheet.

Good hands and a powerful, heavy writ shot that handcuffs goalers -- especially since he lets it fly from all different angles.

Keeps his hands above pad level and has the size to take away the top of the net while shuffling side to side cross crease on his knees with pads on the ice. Keeps his shoulder square to shooters. Cuts down angles, and uses his stick to cover the five hole and redirect pucks into the corners. Excellent prospect.",Toronto
552,106,2017,Matthew_Strome,"Will be the third brother drafted in the Strome family, but a bit of a different type of player than his more skilled older kin. He isn't as polished a skater as his brothers but makes up for it with a much more physical style of play, using his big body to create scoring chances, working the corners. He does possess a quick release, and displays patience in his carries. Displays high end hockey IQ, and gets to the front and scores. Very good in the cycle. The biggest deterrent to him being selected early is he has barely average foot speed and his pitiful off-the-mark acceleration. Needs to work on staying with his assignment in the defensive zone and not heading out before his team has established true possession. Today's NHL is a speed game, where even the big men are fleet afoot. Sure, with proper training and commitment, he will be able to improve in this area. The question is where in the slotting will a team make a selection of a player they know is in need of longer development and has a willingness to wait for him to come along?  In today's NHL, all twelve forwards skate and skate fast. They may be only 5' 8"" , but they aren't a defensive liability numbers-wise. That is the rub on brother number three.",Philadelphia

Able to quickly start and stop, and be a frightening presence. For a man of his size, his stick-handling is off the charts. He plays the puck close to his feet and pops up very quickly, getting maximum torque with shots and passes. His long stride gets him going quick so he can coast, looking like a jumbo jet about to take off. Plays strong on the stick and presents problems all over the attack zone as he turns quickly and then will cut back through the layers.

Is brilliant when he has the puck; an elite passer who can pin-point pass the biscuit while is flight. What he lacks in size he uses his skill and hockey instincts to make up for. Super skilled creative player who has four knocks against him:  1. That he is a one-dimensional player, 2. That he doesn't play with sustained intensity for 60 minutes 3. that he's not committed defensively, and 4. He's an average skater lacking a top end gear. He lacks height but that doesn't get him off the hook to be a better forechecker, back-checker or a puck battler. And he may not be a blazer, but he moves awfully well laterally on the attack. Has a good shot and excellent passing ability. He will need to continue to add strength and two way game including better defensive zone commitment, but looks like a prospect with an offensive nose for the net, and a great feel for getting open offensively.",Minnesota

Very agile and quick, but also has great acceleration and sends opposition defenders to their heels as he blows by them on the attack.

Has taken his game up a notch with less pre-shot ""dancing""-he now relaxes, tracks, and lets the play come to him. Not great on his skates and only shows decent movement and at this juncture, looks stiff and deep in the net. But his size enables him to stay upright and close much of the open net without much movement. Uses his stick well to clear pucks from passes in front and his size lets him get from side to side in one easy motion. Long term developmental guy with upside.

He is never going to put up large scoring numbers, but is a guy who makes your team better and helps you win. A North-South skater with powerful stride and very good acceleration.

Is good at bringing the puck in on the attack, and has good patience when he finally sets up his linemates. Displays soft hands and patience in his carries. A scoring centre who also can line up as a winger. He has a wide skating base, long stride, and balance, which will help take defenders both inside and to the outside, pushing the pace on the attack.

This is a player who is woefully underdeveloped physically, and one who will need time to become naturally accustomed to playing his position without hesitation or thinking. His skating and passing ability is high-end; excellent passer who easily QBs the attack from the top. Plays hard on the puck with his carries in, and has a terrific touch with his set-ups. Can pass while in a backward stride and displays a precise wrist shot from the point. Needs more development to get stronger and add the muscle to aid him in front and when in contact situations with attacking players in his end.

Capable of nice plays with his D to D passes, but his vision and hockey IQ still is not where it should be. Combine that with feet that are slow to adjust to the change in attack and looks that make him become uncomfortable and prone to turnovers. Uses his size along the wall and is a good character kid.

594,62,2017,Jake_Leschyshyn,"Chippy son of former NHLer, Curtis, is an irritating forechecker and disrupter in all three zones. Projects as a future energy player in the bigs if he continues to improve his agility, crisp edging, and lateral explosiveness. Has excellent hand-eye coordination, picks pucks out of the air, and turns them into possessions. He effectively tips in his teammates shots when he sets up as a screen in the paint area in front. Is a great counter player from the middle zone. Has lateral explosion and holds the puck until the opposition starts to close down on him; then his pass will find it’s target while he is in mid-flight. His lateral movement skill and feet are used in his efforts behind the goal line, throwing the defenders in a tizzy with his carries. Make no mistake though; he earns future paycheck with his second efforts in front by creating traffic and his puck battle wins there and in other battle zones.",Vegas
595,60,2017,Antoine_Morand,Quick hands and ability to pounce of rebounds. More of an opportunistic sniper who skates lurking in the perimeters and swoops in to get that quick strike chance. Needs to play stronger on the puck and add strength to his anchor.,Anaheim

Plays with composure and is good at handling the puck. Vey competitive and strong down low.",Buffalo
597,52,2017,Luke_Martin,"Thick, stay at home defender who is now a Freshman at the University of Michigan. Has shown an uptick in his agility and footwork, but continues to be a player who has to work a bit of physicality into every match he plays. If he can, he will body attackers off the puck in this area. Is steady in his own end and makes a crisp breakout pass in transition. Handles the opposition forecheck pretty well. He hasn't displayed much offensive creativity, but like so many players in this class, they are going to need developmental time and could make leaps in improvement.",Carolina
600,56,2017,Josh_Brook,"His fluidness and light edging are what starts the conversation projecting him as an eventually pro defender. He has on-ice tools and a two-way game, but he still is learning to put his game together, making the right decisions, and getting to where he is operating more on instinct with his movements -- just not there yet.

Terrific, well-balanced skater who can hurdle out of his end in breakouts, with excellent hands and hockey IQ. May be accused of trying to do to much solo.

At this juncture, he  doesn’t project as impact up ice offensive performer, but has many tools that are on an uptick. He is a solid stickhandler and can handle the reception of hard passes even on the fly.  Doesn’t rush in his end when the puck comes to him for its trek back to the offensive side; he will start moving his feet before trying to rush it off his stick if there is the time to start moving out. He then finds the best outlet into the attack zone. Has upside with time.",NY Islanders
606,49,2017,Mario_Ferraro,"Undersized two-way defender who is an excellent skater with high end hockey sense, vision, and competitiveness. Plays physical like he is a much bigger guy, and doesn’t see each puck battle as one that he is at a disadvantage. Is so good with his quickness, decisions, and direction change because of his good edging, quickness, and pivots. Reads his own end well and when there are no safe options, he simply carries it out.

607,53,2017,Jack_Studnicka,"Lean two way centreman who leads by example with grit, giddy-up, and great team first gumption. His quick feet get him going and he deceptive slides into open seams looking for the puck. Well schooled and solid in his own end, and is calm and smart during the heat of the play. An unselfish player who will work passing plays from all the areas in front and work the wall and around the horn to unearth pucks too. Although he thinks pass first, he has a been know to surprise with well placed shots while off balance, but was probably looked at as a bottom end centre with his contributions being his strengths and not as a player who would be counted on to score…until he suddenly came on in the playoffs and also with Team Canada at the World U-18s, contributing at a higher rate than anyone had seen until that point. Needs time to develop, and he isn’t a sure thing, but the scoring may improve. He has some skills and good feet, and comes to play a responsible way for 60 minutes, so that makes him a safer selection, albeit one that may not have a high water mark. I see lots of guys making a living in the bigs who fit that very same description.",Boston
608,40,2017,Aleksi_Heponiemi,"Smart undersized centre-forward with figure skater like control in his dashes and darts. A wizard with the puck due to his edge control, he can make the correct cut out of trouble. He utilizes his ability as a precise touch-passer to control which option he is going to with the biscuit. Defenders tend to back off out of respect for his ability camouflage his passes. He's constantly in motion, and eludes contact, slipping through coverage. High hockey IQ player who looks off coverage and blindly hits his intended target with the puck. He positions his small frame to protect himself and the puck and sometimes seems impossible to hit. Stops on a dime. Wins with a quick head, feet, and hands.",Florida

Since then, he's continued to put up great offensive numbers, including 7 points in 4 games for his country internationally. He struggled a little in his first season with Sweden's second-tier league (Allsvenskan), particularly in his play without the puck and defending larger forwards. He still managed to finish 2nd in scoring among U19 defenders. There's skill here, but he needs time to develop his puck handling and fill out his frame.",Detroit
611,36,2017,Jesper_Boqvist,"Lightweight, elusivr Swedish winger with great hands and feet. A change-of-pace skater with great balance and ability to change directions. There is a need for him to get stronger and thicker so he doesn’t get knocked off the puck in skirmishes. Displays a high work ethic and the ability to score in so many different ways; he can score with his one-timer in the circles, use his hand-eye coordination and deflect/tip shots, snatching rebounds in front or off the rush.",New Jersey
612,35,2017,Isaac_Ratcliffe,"A man among boys who displays the raw tools to develop into a NHL power forward. Tough forechecker and good feet for a big man, he has toughness, an active stick, and a good release. Goes to the front without hesitation and is good on the cycle. His size causes problems for the opposition. He displays good hands and when he adds some leg strength he may be even more difficult to contend with.",Philadelphia
613,34,2017,Nicolas_Hague,"Potential big defender in more ways than one. NHL teams continue to have their love affair with huge men at the defensive position who have upside to be top four defenders, since in general the Dmen are getting smaller. For a fellow his size, he has excellent mobility and overall strength. He puts his long stick in the passing lanes and covers ground pretty quickly. Uses his size along the wall and can throw devastating bodychecks. When on the back pedal, he doesn't pivot as quickly as smaller men, but attackers trying to go wide find out how strong he is and how long his stick is. Enjoys playing with an edge. He is growing more of his offensive game, by activating on the rush, and attempting to handle the puck more and more. Still needs work and must hone his carries and be more frugal in the time he holds onto it. Not a finished product, but there will not be a shortage of NHL teams considering him before the bottom third of the first round.",Vegas
614,32,2017,Conor_Timmins,"Promising defense prospect who seems cool and collected in most on-ice situations. Sees, thinks, and reacts at a high level with his passes and attack strategies. A smooth skater and puck-handler who is very smart with where he directs it. Has a great touch and leads his teammates to where his pass is going. Can make the hard-up-ice blueline break-in from the neutral zone, or with sweet saucer passes from both sides of his stick.",Colorado
615,43,2017,Dylan_Samberg,"Minnesota native winner of the Reed Larson award for the state’s best HS senior defenseman in the state. He uses his pro size to play a robust full 200ft game, including finishing on bone-rattling hits. Very strong and mobile, he is well-rounded in all phases and a nice toolbox of skills with room to add more muscle to his frame. He finished the season as a member of the Waterloo USHL team where he will return next year before fulfilling his commitment to the University of Minnesota at Duluth.",Winnipeg
616,33,2017,Kole_Lind,"Sleeper pick in the first. He is one of the best goal scorers in the class, but at this juncture is a lightweight who is tall but thin. Has the frame to carry more girth and may grow an inch or two. Has an excellent wrist snapper he gets off quickly and a booming slapper. He is a really strong skater with good balance and displays good edging that helps him turn abruptly to elude defenders. He isn't afraid to protect himself when he plants himself near the blue paint. A strong skater and very good with his zone entries on the carry in. Really has a good hockey sense and quickly advances the biscuit to create good looks. Seems to capitalize whenever he is able to get loose and get open. He is also a good playmaker and stays involved on the attack. He is at his best when he plays with grit and edge, and his play is trending that way. Has really progressed in his WHL career, but still hasn't reached the 45 goals/79 points in 44 games totals he had in Saskatoon midget, but as he gets bigger and stronger, he may just develop into an NHL power scorer.",Vancouver
617,31,2017,Klim_Kostin,Big man with good balance who is strong on his pins and difficult to move off the puck. Has a decent shot to go with very good stick skills.  Goes hard to the front of the net. Fearless and always willing to take punishment and not back off from returning some. He might be a better player if he didn't have such a pass-first mentality. Suffered a shoulder injury that will shut him down the rest of the season.,St. Louis
618,37,2017,Marcus_Davidsson,"High tempo Swedish centre-forward with excellent speed, lateral agility, and acceleration. Seems to be very active and involved in all three zones. Strong puck pursuit player who pressures to take the puck back, and very fast and elusive in battle areas and tight places when on the attack. Displays a quick release and strong one-timer. Still hasn't shown a dominant offensive game, but has a great first-step burst and a low centre of gravity. He is difficult to stop or take the puck away from. Always moving and an excellent back-checker with an excellent commitment in his own end.",Buffalo
619,27,2017,Morgan_Frost,"200 foot centreman who needs a bit more girth, but he comes to play every game every shift, in all three zones. Really hockey smart, steady, and  instinctive in his own end. Despite not being the biggest guy, he will sacrifice his body to clear the defensive zone, or to try and get pucks in the attack zone.  A smart playmaker with a strong work ethic, good hands, and an obsession to get the loose pucks.",Philadelphia
620,39,2017,Jason_Robertson,"Big left winger with size, speed, a great shot, and  on-ice intelligence. One of his team's leaders. There are thoughts that his game is hampered by his team lacking a top centre to play off of. He still manages to use his quick wrist shot to score on his own, and he is able to create chances for teammates through his stellar work in the attack zone. He Is a powerful skater with good drive, balance, and acceleration. I have heard the constant criticism of his foot speed, but he gets there and is smart enough to do all the work on scoring plays without it being a huge deterent; he lacks a true first step, but no one can convince me his feet hold hIm back in the NHL, and as he improves them, you don't wait for all the rest of the parts of his game to develop...he has lots there already.  He has a terrific release and drives into the slot area, protecting the puck before he shoots or passes it. Very good board player and defensively responsible.",Dallas
621,28,2017,Shane_Bowers,"Highly skilled two way centre that plays a mature 200 game. Has an exceptional hockey IQ and good feet and head. He will slip through the defensive layers to the soft areas and use his quick release to score. He likes the puck on his stick and is a very good passer who is easy for his linemates to follow. He shined at the USHL West Showcase. Still thin, but has room to fill out. The big question is whether scouts and teams see him as a a true NHL second liner or simply with the upside to be a solid 3rd line centre-forward. That, more than anything else, will determine he his name gets called. A very safe pick as the chances are very probable he plays in the league in some capacity.",Ottawa
623,26,2017,Jake_Oettinger,"The BU Freshman goaltender has upped his draft status with a solid season and continued improvement with his calm and athletic game that features solid mechanics, good reads, and fluid crease movements. Tracks the puck well, and is poised and ready in his recovery to make the second save on the second shot. Has good anticipation and has been a keystone in some of his team’s wins.",Dallas
626,23,2017,Pierre-Olivier_Joseph,"A qualitative jump in his all around play has hurtled him upward into the first round discussions. A player who always looked solid as an improving defender but who this season has gained scads of confidence in his ability to be a key component in the attack. Displays mobility and excellent hockey sense, and has that feel for where play is going before it does. Breaks up rushes and plays in his end with a good stick and strong recognition. A power play quarterback whose frame will allow him to get bigger and as he gets stronger, he will add more mustard to the heat he can bring from the point. His brother, Mathieu, was a Tampa Bay draft pick.",Arizona
630,19,2017,Josh_Norris,"Rangy centreman with a long stride who projects as a physical two-way centreman. Strong on the wall, battle areas, and in one on one battles. Good in the dot. Works well down low. Always goes full tilt, never quitting. Will throw pucks at the net from anywhere and then proceed to shake things up looking to retrieve it. Does not have tricky stickhandle moves or slick skating moves, but projects as a pro centre. Committed to the University of Michigan.",San Jose
635,14,2017,Cal_Foote,"Big defenseman with a big point shot. Not necessarily a polished puck carrier, but is surprisingly agile going East-West. He is excellent in his own end to cover attackers and space. Uses his size to win wall and battle zone possessions and will clear the front. No mean streak, but is a really solid competitor for 60 minutes. Plays on both the penalty kill and the power play. Excellent hockey sense and reads his own end well. Stays square on rushers and takes them outside, using his stick to take away their time and space. Very good on his feet and light on his edging, and able to play strong on the puck. Has a good low shot that he places on the net. Needs to fill out and get stronger. The Kelowna system has developed many NHL defenders so he seems in a good position to improve and get selected fairly early. Great bloodlines with his father Adam Foote.",Tampa Bay
636,17,2017,Timothy_Liljegren,"Started the year ranked as a top defenseman prospect based on smooth and mature play from the back end as a puck mover, attacker and PP man, Thick not large, but there is little on the negative side on how well he uses his abilities to defend. A world class skater who has agility mobility and great acceleration, he displays high hockey IQ and reads the ice as well as any NHL defender. Already in the Swedish Elite league and not at all out of place. He really hasn't gotten any bigger or physically stronger, and that might have him sliding down draft lists from top defenseman in the class to maybe a risky selection early on. He is a strong puck mover who will fearlessly lead the attack as a newbie in the SHL. If he does slide, he may make one NHL team's scouting staff look like geniuses.",Toronto
637,13,2017,Nick_Suzuki,"One of the most feared penalty-killers in the OHL, he never goes unnoticed every shift. An under six footer who is a puck magnet, and continually gets loose so his teammates have a scoring outlet.  Responsible defensively and has continued to hone his overall game. Small, but able to both score and set-up his linemates.",Vegas
639,11,2017,Gabriel_Vilardi,"Big solid centre-forward who can score. Has come back from injuries and was a top player in the World Junior U-17s. Displays a two-way game, great skills, and uses his body to make space. Best player in the OHL. Smart, strong on the puck and on the cycle. Makes terrific feeds to his teammates and dominates when pucks are in contention. Can come off the edge with truly strong power moves to the front. He has shown true goal scoring abilities and projects as, at the very least, a top six scorer if the trends continue to improve.",Los Angeles
644,6,2017,Cody_Glass,"Late bloomer with excellent speed, quick hands, and sneaky release. Since last season he gained 20+ pounds and grew more than a couple inches, making him tough to push of the puck in his possessions. Has a high hockey sense - finds the open seams, gets open, and anticipates where the puck will be. Strong on the puck, keeping it away from from opposing defenders. Displays excellent all-around speed. He looks to get even bigger and stronger, and has significant upside.",Vegas
646,4,2017,Cale_Makar,"This small defender has all the making of a future NHL offenseman. Seems to be in constant motion, and able to intercept pucks and turn them in to quick strikes towards his opponent's net. Very undersized and will need plenty more muscle as he continues his development. Cleary one of the smarter and better offensively talented Dmen in the class. The PP QB on his Alberta Junior League team, and has a quick release of a point shot that he gets off without taking a big backswing. He displays strong wrists take enable him to get strength on his shots and zip on his passes. After being selected to play in the World junior Challenge, it what might have been viewed as a step up in competition compared to the players he faces in the AJHL -- but he looked dominant in many phases, using his lateral agility and athletic strides to cut through the neutral zone, activating to open space on the give and go, and reading ensuing plays and covering huge areas of the ice with his feet. His speed and good edging work in consort with his ability to handle the puck at top speed. When he is doesn't have the puck, he looks to jump on errant passes or ones sent cross ice changing possessions. Will pinch but always gets back in position in a few strides because he's so quick. Holds a strong gap. This is a player who creates space and time and plays smart. More of a long term development project -- but he is a player.",Colorado
