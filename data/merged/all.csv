Has been stuck on Flint with no help for two seasons. If the World Juniors Under-18 showed us anything, it was that he quickly meshed with different line-mates and outworked the opposition night after night. Grinds away whether it be keeping pucks alive on the offense or with dogged forechecking to turn the puck over.  Excellent vision and playmaking ability.

This player compensates for it with terrific hands and ability to push the pace, doing a decent job in his own end using his skill set. In the Swedish junior league, Boqvist showcased a nice shot, high end speed, and agility. He may very well be the top finesse and fine-edge-skating defenseman in the draft, displaying great balance and lateral mobility. He is lightning fast and has great vision. He distributes the puck unselfishly and he jumps in on the attack -- sometimes leading it. He opens up and delivers a very accurate one timer. As a slight, smaller player, he gets overtaken, losing puck battles to the bigger players. Does show good vision in both ends but it is a bigger challenge in his own end. His fast feet help negate some of his problems in the defensive zone, but it is difficult to ignore his defensive zone positioning issues. As a lightweight anchor, he needs to fill out, get stronger, and build his defensive game.

About five foot ten, he has one of the highest hockey IQ in this class. Moreover, he is one of the fastest and most agile skaters at his position with the jump to not only get to top gear rapidly, but gear down to a complete stop to reverse or change direction -- slowing down the ice and controlling the play with the ""freeze."" He has been heralded for years as a player destined to be selected in the top couple selections. He displays elite feet, balance and edge work. He wants the puck on his stick on zone entries and even chooses to skate the puck solo when the puck transitions to him in his defensive zone. He is so fast that he is able to jump in on the attack on most offensive forays. Always looking for the dynamic pass to set up a goal, the competitive nature in all zones is terrific and fearless. The team that drafts him knows he will use his stick positioning, feet, and lateral quickness to defend, and will fall short against stronger bigger attackers who will win the majority of physical confrontations. A team drafting him will have to devise a plan to protect him in his end, maybe even pull back the reins.",240,3,0,5,2,3,Vancouver,U. of Michigan [Big-10],Quinn_Hughes,D,1,True
6,2018,"At six foot and 190, he is a dynamic scoring wing who just keeps getting scoring chances-- and capitalizes on them. Solid skater with lateral agility, but he isn’t a blazer, so he exploits the seams & soft spots in coverage. Displays quick hands and a scorers mentality, but doesn’t necessarily use his agility as a one trick pony in the attack zone. He is responsible in all three zones and is competitive in backside pressure. His forte is on the power play; he is able to generate chances, get to soft areas, and use his head and hands to shoot the puck. Has a wicked one-timer, and a quick release - cannon of a snap shot. Has been an elite attacker in the QMJHL. Very patient and has a smart sense about where he should be in the attacking zone. He can beat you with a surprising heavy perimeter shot, or simply gets in closer and sniffs around for scores in the area. Seems to swoop into existing puck battles and come out untouched, quickly moving into the blue dot. He makes the goalie start changing his position and takes advantage with his sneaky backhand or quick wrister. He lit up the World Juniors U-20 for Czech with seven goals in seven games at 18 years of age. He has emerged as one of the top picks in the class because his fiery offensive capabilities may continue to develop into the pro game. And I don't think moving him to left wing compromises his ability to score and make plays.

There is plenty to like about him in terms of his commitment and continuing improvement. You draft him knowing he doesn’t project as a top line impact center; just a guy the coach will love because he can play in all situations and slide in anywhere in the bottom nine and make the guys around him better. Selfless, serious, high IQ guy in the offensive end, drawing more than one attacker to him, only to deceptively get the puck to an open teammate.

The nicest kid you would ever want to meet off the ice, but transforms when he skates onto the ice. He refuses to let up or stop being physically involved. He has great balance and solid skating abilities. Possess decent speed and agility. He showed his ability in the World Junior U-20 where he won puck battle after puck battle and set up a number of big goals, notable late-game tying and winning goals in the round robin against both Canada and Slovakia. Combines his long stride with very good stick-handling prowess and long reach. He is able to make time for linemates with his possessions. Extremely creative and shows finesse in his set ups, but more importantly his demeanor is such that he takes the responsibility of winning on his shoulders. He has a high upside, not a limited ceiling that some suggest. Can dominate down low and between the dots. Retrieves pucks by way of physical checks and honest wall work. There are no warts in his game, and he has shown in college games that he can play and dominate against older more developed young men. He isn't the fastest player from a dead start, but good enough in a straight line to fill holes, block shots, and position himself as a threat in more ways than one. There is no denying by any scout that the offensive skills are there, and will grow. No growth is necessary as a team guy and possible future NHL captain. When he is promoted to the NHL, he will be a plug and play stand alone player who can compete and win, no matter where/who he plays with.

He can also defend away from the puck, or be so strong on the puck. But surely when he was finally elevated to first line centre in the U-18 Worlds, he showed a high end potential. Did that now project him as a forceful, physical future NHL centre? The fact that he is very proficient in the face-off circle might have NHL scouting staffs figuring he should get ample chances to develop as a pivot. Strong on his skates in his possessions and very effective on the defensive side. Needs a step to get going and is straight line attacker, but is patient and sneaky with a good wrist shot, and possesses the ability to gift-wrap pucks to teammates.

He still needs to make use of his linemates, understand how to use his speed as a device to set up the five man attack, and needs to keep adding strength. Plays aggressive, hard, and with grit, projecting as a power forward. A creative three zone player who was able to impose his will and be on equal footing with grown men in the KHL.

Has been at the top or close to the top in defenseman scoring this entire year in the OHL. He was named captain of his club, and plays really smart in both ends. Has good balance and good four-direction skating ability, despite not being categorized as an agile lateral mover with a big burst up ice. Thinks the game at an elite level, and in March was leading his team in scoring. Has little problem getting involved up ice on the rush and is very comfortable using his skill set and decision-making to create from the blue line. He has an excellent hard point shot, but always looks for the best pass too. Skates a bit upright, but it doesn’t hamper his vision or coolness in his own end and when things are starting to develop on the offensive. The sport has reached a skill level where there is a division that separates the position of defenseman into two distinct type styles, and at this point, Bouchard falls into the ""has decent size and power, but lacks that lightning speed"" side.

Already better then most “Q” defenders at using his mobility, reach, stick, and to have his stick on the right side of the puck carrier. Deceptively fast and always willing to lug the biscuit up ice. Because he is bigger and his stride is so fluid, he catches you off guard with how fast he can accelerate and then surprises again when he executes at top speed. Jumps up from the blue line deep in to the attack zone and has the speed to get himself back up ice. Has a slapper he keeps low and a strong accurate wrist shot. You would like a bit more physicality and see him push attackers off the puck. While he shows he can separate players from the puck decently although, they won’t be looking to see if he is coming next shift.

His game includes creativity while jumping in, good decisions defensively, and a growing offensive toolbox that allows him to play at a quick pace. He rarely turns pucks over, and always positions himself to close down the attackers.

He sees the ice well and generates chances while making room for his linemates. His all-around game and focus are a work in progress, as he can tend to focus only on the offensive side, forgeting the other things that are necessary.

Not easy to move off the puck, he projects as another high level Russian import who can make an impact in the NHL either on wing or center. He was accused of again disappearing in the World Under-18, and afterward it was announced he was diagnosed with mononucleosis. An interesting parallel is in the 2007 draft, when Logan Couture was still on the board at slot nine, due to the fact he had a lackluster draft year after getting mono and never truly recovered for the entire season.

Like his linemate, Yakupov, he also moves well, with balance and powerful stride and is strong on the puck. Both are scorers and offensive generators, and difficult to typecast as one over the other. Has a strong hard wrist shot, but his biggest strength is his great stick-handling skills. Both players basically provided most of their Sarnia Jr. team's offensive. Galchenyuk reads the ice and takes full advantage of the situations to control the flow of play. His on-ice awareness, which gets him to the proper spaces offensively and in the other two zones, only makes him more dangerous. Dangles as well as any player in the draft and his top-end speed and drive to the net are in no way tied to his line mate.

In the Finnish pro league, he controls the tempo, and is tremendously strong when in control of the puck, and was the ninth leading scorer as a 17 year old. This man is the real deal, his short area quickness seals the deal that a GM shouldn't pass on him for another forward.

106,2011,"Undersized opportunistic scorer with great stick skills and superb vision, as well as some jump. Good hands and big play ability. Very Good Hockey IQ when diagnosing the ice.

97,2011,"Wasn't drafted last year, but his additional college time has caused improvement in this Colorado native's game. Skates and moves well. His arms let him use his stick to clog passing lanes.

95,2011,"Plays his position effectively and has no apparent weaknesses in his ability to move the puck up-ice. He isn't the best skater so he will have to improve to move to the higher levels.

77,2011,"Undersized fireball with great stick skills, superb vision, and speed.  Every time he steps on the ice he reminds me of the when Lou Angotti was thrown on the ice for a short shift, and he relentlessly went full speed the entire time, trying to make an explosive impact. He was able to since he was taking not a regular shift. You have to wonder how effective this lad would be as the level of competition rises and everyone naturally moves at a higher quickness level.",86,0,0,12,0,0,Buffalo,Soo Greyhounds [OHL],Daniel_Catenacci,C,3,False

73,2011,"Developing effective two-way defender who goes unnoticed due to his solid error-free play. He has a quick stick and will stand up for teammates.

If he could develop an edge it would be to his advantage as he seems to be balanced enough to stay in control when he does play aggressively.
