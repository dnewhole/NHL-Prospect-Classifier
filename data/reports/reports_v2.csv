52,2013,Justin Bailey,"Tall and skinny winger with soft and hands and excellent anticipation. He has good speed, and strong push in his stride. He uses a shorter stick that allows him to play well in traffic and will use his skill and athleticism to his advantage. Creates shooting lanes and has a nice release. Dislaps a quick release. Creates turnovers and is smart with his passes. He must improve balance, and add leg strength."
45,2013,Nick Sørensen,"Hightly-touted Danish-Swedish prospect needed reconstructive surgery on his ACL & MCL and will not play again until this 2012-13 season. Prior to the injury, he displayed tremendous first steps, a set of gears that combined with his passing and smarts to project him as a player with significant upside. His development has been stifiled by the rule which limits each team in the ""Q"" to only suit two European born players per team, and his Quebec team has ""vets"" Grigorenko and Kucherov ahead of him. He is a rising prospect whose draft slotting may be decided on him playing more. It was thought that Quebec would trade him, but he did get playing time until Grigorenko returned from Buffalo. he still managed 20 goals and 47 points in 46 games during the season, and 7 goals, 10 points in 8 games in the QMJHL playoffs."
46,2013,Gustav Olofsson,"Moved to the U.S. four years ago and has provided Green Bay with a solid stay-at-home defender who shows up-ice competence. Uses his reach,stick, and body to break up plays. Has a high panic level when he has the puck, and makes the outlet pass with regularity. He is committed to Colorado College."
51,2013,Carl Dahlström,"Strong large molded Swedish defenseman that is refining his game. Active, smart ,fluid and strong on the puck when in possession. Has good feet, improved stick-handling and is showing he belongs on the draft lists. Possesses a big hard shot. Does so many things good dee-men already. Makes the outlet pass, closes his gaps, clearing the crease, etc. Plays big time minutes, and an strong defensive side. He has plenty of developing to do, but has outstanding upside."
59,2011,Rasmus Bengtsson,"More of a stay at home defender who does have a nice shot from the point. A bit heavy booted, and time will tell if he can improve enough to make a mark in the NHL."
48,2013,Zach Natasiuk,"Versatile player with willingness to aggressively compete. Is very good on the cycle, but has balance issues. Shows some grit in his forecheck. Strong shot. He needs to improve footspeed, foot work and his skill levels in all phases. There is some upside, the question is just how much.  He was selected to the roster for the World Junior Under-18 Tournament in April."
47,2013,Tom Vanelli,"Aggressive offensive defender with a top gear, who is equally assertive defensively. Tremendous stride and balance.  Offensive gambler who wants to make things happen and skates the puck very well, and is dangerous in transistion. Shows strong physicality in his own zone, and although unpolished, and still not showing top strength at this juncture, he shows good upside. He still has lots to learn and work on, but the guy is simply leads by example with plenty of enthusiasm. Tremendous upside based on his all around infectious all around aggressive energy and effortless jump. He was selected to the roster for the World Junior Under-18 Tournament in April, and scored a big goal against the Russian team.  He is committed to the University of Minnesota."
186,2011,Aaron Harstad,"Undrafted last year, he is a mobile defenseman with PP experience."
44,2013,Tristan Jarry,"Athletic hybrid goaler with good size and ability, but needs time. Possesses plenty of positive attributes and strengths that projecting going off the board early in round two of the draft, including a good glove, squaring up, hold his ground, and staying calm and collected."
50,2013,Dillon Heatherington,"Defense-first backliner who is good in transition. Strong positional skater who limits opponents chances due to his calmness and smarts. Plays a make it simple style and uses his teammates as safety valves, and doesn't try and do too much. He may need to improve stop & starts, but moves well laterally, and adding a little more aggression to his game might make him even more desirable. Does have some grit to his game, and since he will be looked at as 3rd pairing guy, that might be a prerequisite to advance. Excellent functional strength and good instincts.  He was selected to the roster for the World Junior Under-18 Tournament in April."
49,2013,Gabryel Paquin-Boudreau,"Displays good speed, and offensive gifts. A developing first year player, who shows creativity on the attack, but needs to continue growing stronger. Plays at a high rate of speed and handles the puck well. Will never be a large guy, but he is a creative sniper with superb first step acceleration, and tremendous cutting ability to go with quick passes, and a good wrister. Kills penalities and ahs been asked to be a shutdown centre too."
210,2014,Jacob Middleton,"A big defender who has excellent mobility, size, and snarl. Has good feet and pivots for a bigger man, and was strong and mean along the wall. Seems like more of a development pick at this point. He hasn't figured out how to use his speed to pressure and close as well as he should, and if he can improve on the back end and add some offense, I suspect he will climb the boards."
208,2014,Jack Ramsey,"Big wing has size and uses it. At this juncture is more of a North-South trailer on the attack. A developing player who has a strong wall presence and due to his size and strength can win battles in front and in all battle areas. A hard hit hitter who still needs polish as a guy in control of the puck, there is lots to like with the unfinished product. Committed to the University of Minnesota."
209,2014,Spencer Watson,"Gifted scorer who has a knack for scoring. Very smart player who has a feel for the game situations and quickly makes the most of them. Whether it's crashing the front, or flying off the wall with the puck to shake things up from the middle, he is a dangerous attacker with lightning release. Lacks great size, strength and speed, but still is already an impact player in the OHL."
207,2014,Jake Evans,Thin six footer plays sixty minutes is responsible in his own end. good balance and stride but needs to increase foot speed. Good on the cycle. and at this point is more passer than shooter.
204,2014,Julien Nantel,"Displays plenty of the attributes that NHL wings must have. Has a good strong skating stride, size, and strength. Excellent on the wall and corners. Wins puck battles and is good on the cycle. uses his strength and strong skating to fight for possession in all zones. Has yet to find a constitent offensive game."
206,2014,Emil Johansson,"Solid skating undersized defenseman who has excellent balance and backward movement. Understands his how to play his position and uses his mobility to stay in position in his zone. Reads situations well, but sometimes gets ahead of himself when has puck possession and feels pressure."
202,2014,Dwyer Tschantz,"The only current Midget Major forward listed on the NHL Central Scouting Bureau's Players to Watch List, based on his combination of tremendous size and developing hands and feet."
205,2014,Ondrej Kase,"Undersized Czech wing who displays creativity, slick moves and excellent passing skills. Not the fastest guy, but one who comes out of high traffic areas with the puck on his stick, and the soft hands to get it where he wants.  An excellent playmaker with a quick wrister.  Not fast, just slippery, and agile, he is deadly on the rush, making monkeys out of the defenders who attempt to close in and stop him. Has patience, vision, playmaking skills, a nice saucer pass, and good awareness. A member of his homeland’s team roster for the World Junior Under-20 at Christmas 2014."
217,2017,Will Reilly,Will Reilly
212,2017,Ivan Chekhovich,"High skilled elite forechecker who unearths pucks and scores by driving into the faces of the opposing defenders and contesting for pucks that should has never gone to him. A puck hound who will take the biscuit and ramp to top gear, then be in position for his own rebound. He seems to ramp up when there's a hint of being part of an odd man break -- as if he smells blood. Goes wide with the puck far from the opposing defenders and turns back in to the scoring area. He also will gain the line and weave, so his second and third layers of teammate/attackers can join in. Decent player in his own end; positions himself well and blocks shots. Can take the the hard pass at top speed and also surprise defenders who think the puck is safe…until he steals it back."
211,2017,Croix Evington,Committed to the Division I UMass-Lowell.
208,2017,Phil Kemp,"A big athletic defenseman with good skating ability but needs to work on pivots and turns. Better when he is in open space or not in close quarters. Ends up having trouble when pressured and turns many pucks over. Uses his size as deterrent along the boards, and his stick to clog lanes.  He displays an emerging offensive game in the attack zone, but needs to improve his puck skills and in-game IQ. Long term developmental player."
216,2017,Jacob Paquette,"Bigger bodied defender who projects at this juncture as a defense-first stay at home player. A rock in front of his own net, and takes care of clearing it out. Has a solid stride and good jump when moving around his end and in his play in transition. Knows his limitations offensively and plays to his own strengths: bodying opponents out, pin and seals with gusto, and using his thick huge frame to his advantage. Physical in the corners and the front. Is disciplined enough to play a firm simple game in his own end. If a team is looking for a well-rounded defenseman, he ranks as a long term developmental guy, who you hope gains confidence, grows, and offensive side."
60,2015,Oliver Kylington,"Clearly one of the top end elite skaters and puck movers in the class. Has the ability to play in tight space and control the puck and play. Plays like he knows he has more ability than the rest of the ice, and is poised and composed in all phases when he gets a puck in his end. He is able to work out with smart passes or carry the mail with top acceleration. Good in his one end, and although not overly big framed, he have the stamina to fight through the rough going and excel. A member of his homeland’s team roster for the World Junior Under-20 at Christmas 2014."
124,2015,Ethan Bear,"Excellent defensive defenseman who has an aggressive stick, blocks tons of shots, handles one on ones, strips away pucks and refuses to any room in his zone. Clears the front. Will relieve pressure by carrying the puck out of his zone. Excels on the pK and is a key component to his team’s success there. His offensive side needs work and he probably needs to be more confident enough with shooting the puck."
214,2017,Matthew Hellickson,Committed to the University of Norte Dame.
114,2018,Ivan Prosvetov,Grew more than a half a foot in 18 months and now qualifies as an interesting option as a netminder prospect.
57,2018,Axel Andersson,"Long term developmental defender who needs to add better habits, gamble less in his end, and play with more grit. Strong on the puck and able to hold it in his end without losing possession. Needs better awareness and presence in his end. Very skilled skater and puckhandler with flash and dash. A high patience player when under forechecking pressure. Long term developmental RHD who needs to continue to build his overall game."
211,2015,John Dahlström,"Thick hard working Swedish winger with good balance and feet and hockey sense. Has a 200 foot game and an accurate wrist shot, and good offensive instincts."
181,2018,Dustyn McFaul,Committed to Clarkson University.
208,2016,Ryan Lohin,Committed to University of Massachusetts -Lowell.
206,2016,Otto Somppi,"Quebec league import with high skill and puck-handling ability. Has the skill to wiggle and weave through traffic and make plays. Quebec league import with high skill and puck-handling ability. An early season shoulder injury stalled his progress a bit. An aggressive push the pace set-up man who always is trying to get the opposition on their heels. Has the skill to wiggle and weave through traffic and make plays. He is quick and tenacious on the forecheck, pressuring opposing defenders into the bad puck decisions. He has a good shot which he releases quickly, and good touch when in close. Gets back his defensive zone and works hard to break things up and provide backside pressure away from the puck. Developmental centre-forward who needs to get thicker and be able to anchor down and hold possession."
203,2016,James Jake Ryczek,Solid defensively and attacks on offense with reckless abandon. Big time one timer. Committed to Providence College.
205,2016,Tyler Soy,"When you see him on the sheet, he seems younger and thinner than everyone else. Has a really short compact stride and he keeps the feet moving the entire shift. Sees the surface well and is good at positioning himself, and anticipating the possible developing play. Is very undeveloped, and needs weight room work to make him able to compete in so many of the areas he now seems a lightweight in. If he can get stronger, he will be able to compete physcality in the areas necessary, his perimeter shot will get stronger, and he will get better in most areas. Good playmaker who needs much more weight to withstand the physicality his up tempo strong forechecking style causes. He has soft hands, is a good face-off man, and always keeps his feet in motion. Has long term upside, and already shows great hand-eye coordination, moves to the open areas in lanes, and seems to place the puck wherever he iswants it to go. Clearly the team that selects him will wait but there may be a strong payoff as he improves his physical development."
201,2016,Ty Ronning,"Once thought of as undersized and injury-prone, he started flying out of the ashes from the CHL prospects game and had a 30 goal and 59 point season, without the luxury of a high edn centreman to feed him the puck.  Relentless in puck pursuit, very similar to his father, Cliff, a former NHLer. A quick agile skater who attacks the goalie with patience and cuts and weaves fearlessly  in the attack zone, eventually having the goaltender commit and for him to capitalize. Can take a hit and make the play. Projects as a small fourth line NHLer with hustle and jump."
200,2016,David Quenneville,"Continues to impress all watchers with his Ivan Hlinka & World U-18 performances as a 5' 8"" defensemen with a big-time point shot, and high end offensive skills. Uses his thick, meaty fireplug body to hit players with authority. Very cool and rarely panics under pressure, always looking for the outlet pass.The stickling point is his size and making it work at the NHL level."
199,2016,David Bernhardt,"Solid two-way defender who has a good reach and stick to strip pucks and close lanes. Can be a dominant physical presence and probably need to continue to improve this aspect as his is how his pro bread will be buttered, not as an offense man, although he does have a heavy point shot. He can activate to join the play. Needs to improve pivots as attackers close try and fly-by."
197,2016,Mattias Elfström,"A big winger who has great skating ability and gets to top speed fairly quickly. You don’t expect to see a prospect this big with the speed to breakaway from the junior defenders, but he does. After they play against him a few rushes, they see how he  forces them to back off. Displays a good strong shot, very good hands and an emerging physicality. He can beat you one on one, with a shot from the perimeter, or with body work. Projects as a player who can develop into a power player."
194,2016,Brett McKenzie,"A centre forward who projects as a long term developmental project at wing. Hard worker who handles the puck well, but must learn positioning discipline and play when doesn’t have it. Must support better. Must start to use his developing size, speed, and frame and engage contact, and work harder to get pucks back."
193,2016,Nick Pastujov,"Ellenton rink rat and Bradenton Florida native and USNTDP  Junior team member is solidly built six footer who is still developing, and has no weaknesses that will be impediments in the growth process. A lunch pail centre who might project to the wing, he finishes his checks and plays hard in both ends. Scored two important goals at the U-18 Five Nations in February. He has committed to the University of Michigan."
192,2016,Jeremy Davies,Committed to Northeastern University.
195,2016,Ben Finkelstein,Committed to St. Lawrence University.
196,2016,Dimitri Sokolov,"Has gone from a tiny high skilled forward to a solidly built one who can dominate with high end skill. Doesn’t possess high end jump but sees and reads the on ice situations to his advantage.Tends to over-carry the puck instead of advancing it to better scoring options. Very strong and solid with significant upside to project as a top nine player, if he could get more interest in being a factor when he doesn't have the puck. To this point, he seems like a player who oozes with upside, but has done very very little to apply his strengths in the team game."
191,2016,Travis Barron,"Powerful tenacious winger. and grinder candidate who loves to jam the front with abandon. At times has shown nice stick-handling skills and at times some elusiveness, but the fact remains there have been long stretches where he seems slow, behind the play and unable to form a cohesiveness with teammates to make “looks” that go into the back of the net. Truly disappointing growth, and his 15 goals (two in the five playoff games) can’t be viewed as reason to be excited if he still on the board in the third round."
182,2016,Nikolai Chebykin,"Big framed Russia centre-forward with decent puck skills, and boots. A long strider who can carry the biscuit, and score. Long term developmental project who needs work in may areas."
181,2016,Joseph Masonius,Committed to the University of Connecticut.
189,2016,Austin Osmanski,"Big bodied defender who projects as a shutdown guy. Makes good decisions and is positionall strong Has an active stick, and is strong at boxing out in front of his net. Strong already, but still is a work in progress."
186,2016,Stefan Falkowsky,"What the Belarusian behemoth has going for him is the Ottawa 67 import with the wingspan of a airplane, high end skills, and a rocket wrist shot that has lots behind it. On the downside, he is going to needs plenty of developmental time to learn the nuances of playing the defensive zone. And at this point he has no interest into using his physical gifts to strike terror in the hearts of opposing players. This is a grab and wait prospect."
170,2016,Collin Adams,Committed to the University of North Dakota.
169,2016,Tanner Laczynski,"A forward who does most things well, but none spectacularly. Unselfish complementary player with a smart and unselfish game. Does all the little things that teams need to win. Drops back when one of his defenseman activates, works the wall and greasy areas. Will continue to develop his game in college, as he has committed to Ohio State University"
173,2016,Blake Hillman,"USHL defender who plays a simple style with success. Does everything well at the level he is playing, but needs more strength and girth."
172,2016,Dante Salituro,"Superb short stocky centre who is a top skater that can make plays at top speed. Dynamic top end skater with great jump and dangle at breakneck speed. A great skater whose balance makes tough to knock him off the puck. Any loose puck has a chance of being his because he works hard to unearth them and make chances for his team. A battler who doesn’t seem to view himself as the smaller guy and it can hurt him. He is so surprisingly quick and has a very deceptive shot. His puck skills let him set up his linemates, and he makes sure he is in position in the defensive end. Works hard, and leads by example. He is more of a long term prospect because he needs lots more core strength and then he will become a bigger threat."
166,2016,Matthew Phillips,Elite speed and agility that makes him elusive in the attack zone. Frightfully small and that will be an issue as he climbs the tiers to the pro game. Will some team take a chance that he grows and defeats the odds? Stay tuned.
159,2016,Brandon Hagel,A thin wing who wins pucks and controls tempo despite the lack of muscle and girth on his frame. A long term prospect who competes and has upside.
154,2016,Jakob Stukel,"Developing player with elite speed and feet. Gets the jump on defenders and shows up in scoring areas much quicker than they expect. Finds the soft spots surprises them with his scoring chances. Needs time to develop, but you can’t teach speed."
152,2016,Jack Walker,"Third year eligible player who was recruited as a defenseman in 2012-2013, but switched to wing 20 games in and then back to defense 2013-14, and finally settled in as scoring winger last season potting 36 goals & 84 points during the regular season and 8 goals & 16 points in 13 WHL playoff games. The under six footer has always been fleet afoot and has now almost 180 pounds. He attended the Minnesota Wild's Development Camp in July,2015, continuing at the NHL Prospects Tournament in Traverse City, Mich., and extending into training camp, but the team in his home state didn’t offer him a contract, so he returned to Victoria, where things worked out."
149,2016,Graham McPhee,"Hard working winger with a bit of edge. He works hard in the battle areas and has in the past displayed some offensive upside, but still has been limited to a supporting roles, and was on the USA Under 18 team as a 4th line checker. He finishes his checks and makes space and comes in hard on the forecheck. He is good in puck pursuit, and is good on the PK. He is committed to Boston College, where he maybe able to develop the offensive of his game."
143,2016,Mathias From,"Big Danish wing who grew bigger during the summer. Plays  more of a power wing role, but has a decent shot and some skill. He is strong in back side pressure and solid defensively already."
141,2016,Tim Gettinger,"Oversized lanky wing with surprising feet and mobility, hockey sense and hands. has long term potential as an NHL power forward down the road. Plays on bothe the PP and PK. A three zone player with a good release, soft hands, and inside touch. Plays pretty strong with the puck and along the boards, and makes good decisions in all phases. Long term prospect with good upside."
142,2016,Mikey Eyssimont,"Colorado-born college Freshman who was a Freshman at St. Cloud State. He was named the 2016 North Star College Cup Most Valuable Player for his performance of five points (3G-2A) points in two tourney games, and helping the Huskie to their their first ever title."
150,2016,Manuel Wiederer,"A German import now in his last year of draft eligibility is in his first seaosn in the Q, where he can be arguably called a top two way forward in the league. Displays great skating and and ability as a shutdown forward, while scoring 30 goals and a point per game."
137,2016,Jordan Sambrook,"First year defender who has mobility, size physicality and confidence in his play. Very thin, but has room for his athletic frame. Strong on his pins with good edging and pivots. Is reliable and mistake free because he  patient and smart when carrying the puck or when he has has a chance to activate. Effective in all phases and lots of room to grow his game, and add muscle."
138,2016,Patrick Harper,Committed to Boston University.
136,2016,Cameron Clarke,"Second year eligible late bloomer who was good size and skills, and is committed to Ferris State University."
145,2016,Beck Malenstyn,"Large bodied left winger who skates well and has good functional strength who finishes his checks and puts pressure on the opposition. Can generate chances. Will play hurt.Although more on straight line skater he has a strong burst with top end acceleration that allows him to get away from his checks. Strong player in the corners and battle areas. Separates opponents from the biscuit. Better when he keeps it simple, and looks for loose pucks continue to finish his checks (as he does) and makes quick decisions in his offensive zone possessions. Potential power wing."
133,2016,Max Lajoie,"Sometimes too much is asked. This may well be the case with LaJoie. He is very good skater with mobility and composure on the attack side. He is his team's PP QB.  He is light on his edges and can navigate the ice well in his carries.  He is effective with his poke checks, and can skate pucks out of danger. He very slender and gets knocked off the puck, or just off balance. Plays with an active stick and although he doesn't run around his own end, he struggles in the defensive zone, especially in his down low coverage. Doesn't seem to have a body that he can build to compensate for the way he gets out-muscled. He does have parts of a two way game and doesn't panic under pressure, but he just is unable to make enough good decisions that compensate for his liabilities."
130,2016,Vojtěch Budik,"Czech import to the dub who already displays terrific defensive zone tools and has some upside to add the attack component. He is a long strider with a effortless glide and deceptive explosion when it is needed. An agile defender with excellent footwork and defensive awareness. Displays  high end hand-eye coordination, which helps in defending. Smartly boxes out attackers gap control; and positioning; spaces himself off the hip of the shooters and works from there. Makes outlet passes easily and can help his attack by moving in and applying pressure. A work in progress."
131,2016,Adam Werner,Färjestad J20
128,2016,Colton Point,Big goalie who was the MVP for the Canadians Championship team in the CCHL. Committed to Colgate University.
127,2016,Jordy Stallard,A big framed off handed winger / centre who is starting to come into his own. Moves well and handles the biscuit at high speed. Fearless and willing to take the hit to make the play. Defensively aware and responsible and in the attack zone gets back and covers the point when the dee-man activates. Displays soft hands and can handle hard passes and advancing while on the move. Developing player who may get even better.
124,2016,Casey Staum,Commited to the University of Nebraska-Omaha
123,2016,Dylan Wells,"One of the top goaltender prospects in the class, he has confidence, concentration and rebound control. Tracks puck very well and almost always makes the first save. Attacks rebounds with his soft pads and works his tail off in games and in practice. Has shown he can carry the heavy load game after game. Traffic in front doesn’t faze him, and plays the angles well."
125,2016,Nolan Stevens,The son of John Stevens is a creative centreman who thinks the game well and can stickhandle in a phone booth. He has a high hockey IQ and it shows in his competition. sees the ice and distributes the puck well on the give and go. Plays poised and calm. Has average speed at this juncture but a nice stride. He needs to be a whole lot stronger. Fearless in the dirty areas and very competitive in all roles he is asked to perform. Blocks shots.
129,2016,Philip Nyberg,Committed to the University of Wisconsin.
215,2018,Austin Wong,Stocky undersized centre who is committed to Harvard University.
216,2018,Riley Hughes,"Good skating attacking winger with hands, vision, and ability to make offensive plays. Committed to Northeastern University, where he will learn to improve his commitment in battle zone engagements and along the wall."
126,2016,Mitch Mattson,"Big and really can skate well., and advances the puck well. Displays a strong stride, nice passing skills, and is committed to playing a 200 foot game. Needs to build his underdeveloped frame. Looks like he might project as the big centre teams look for.  So far he hasn't  blossomed into a scorer, but there is time  to develop in college as he has committed to the University of North Dakota."
217,2018,Eric Florchuk,"Big Centre-wing whose feet have improved radically in the course of the season. He has improved his skating stride's length to accommodate his longer legs. Very light on his edging and a creative stickhandler. Mystifies defenders and finds his passing outlets after rolling off coverage when his scoring chance closes. Pushes opponents off pucks on the forecheck and any place where he can jump in and can leverage. Hockey smarts and fearless in traffic, has a coasting gear. Really controls the attack zone looks. Far from a finished product as he still needs work in many areas. There is is plenty of upside. He sprouted up a few inches and needs time to fill out."
206,2018,Radim Salda,"Thin mobile defender with good size and skill. Second year eligible. Smart with his carries and puck movement. Strong power play point shot. Pinches in well in the attack zone, and battles hard for puck possession on the wall. His attack skills are rapidly progressing. Good skater but isn’t accomplished at taking his skating ability and using it to improve his play. He will stop moving his feet when taking on rushing defenders. He will drift out of position in his own zone when the opposition has possession, and seems easily manhandled in front of his own net."
205,2018,Marcus Westfält,"Big winger who played for the first time in the top SHL. He is a large kid who shows a willingness to bull to the front and and displays in many instances, strong lean while along the boards in the battle areas. A good skater who has jump enough to come out of the corner separated from his check and thus becoming a dangerous target or shooter. When the season started everyone jumped on the bandwagon, extolling his attributes. So maybe the present quiet calm is a smoke screen so he is on the board when the team that likes him is on the mike."
209,2018,Zachary Bouthillier,"Goalie who is long term developmental guy who came into his own by the end of this season. Aggressive between the pipes, challenging shooters and playing the angles well."
204,2018,Trey Fix-Wolansky,Terrific attacker/puck battler who despite his diminutive size forces turnovers and uses his straight line speed to bull his way through the attack zone.
211,2018,Semyon Kizmov,"Underrated competitive winger with good size, two-way game, and offensive skills."
201,2018,Cole Krygier,Committed to the University of Wisconsin.
196,2018,Christian Krygier ,Solid defenseman with size and mobility. Committed to the University of Wisconsin.
197,2018,Jake Kucharski,Committed to Providence College.
200,2018,Tyler Tucker,"His start was slowed by a preseason injury but he was able to put himself on the radar with good feet, and passing ability. Besides having outstanding skating ability, he also has shown a willingness to play with physicality."
198,2018,Dmitri Zavgorodny,"Runs hot & cold in terms of compete level. Another player, who at his present size must build a consistent game fulll of competitveness, game after game."
194,2018,Luke Loheit,Committed to the University of Minnesota-Duluth.
189,2018,Liam Kirk,"Long term British hopeful from the top English League. Tall, thin, with really good dash, feet, and a high offensive skill level. Is a project that will need to leave home for the CHL or a strong Swedish team and begin adding muscle. Needs to grow his game against tougher competition."
185,2018,Xavier Bouchard,"Long-term developmental defender that may be able to hit paydirt and make it worth the wait. Has size strength and skating ability, and is very good at anchoring. Keeps opponents boxed out. He simply is off far too much on his passes and the it is almost like there is a bomb on the end of his stick that explodes into a turnover. Patience and excellent developmental coaching is what will be needed."
183,2018,Cole Koepke,Committed to the Univ. of Minnesota-Duluth.
184,2018,Jared Moe,2nd year eligible
193,2018,Josiah Slavin,"Brother of Jaccob, he is committed to Colorado College."

182,2018,John Leonard,Committed to UMass (Amherst).
119,2016,Tanner Kaspick,"An elite shooter who finishes without any hesitation. Very strong on his skates, he capitalizes on any opening he is given, and is the guy no one saw sneak in for the backdoor play. Works hard on the forecheck."
114,2016,Riley Stillman,Plays big even though he isn't.
113,2016,Nathan Noel,"Is trying to reprieve a disappointing 2013-14 season. He short and undersized at 174 pounds. He is a swift playerwho darts in on the rush and off the cycle. Has good scoring touch with his hard wrist shot, and is very agile. Provides nice feed and drop passes. Part of teh reason he was drafted two times before is it took him until this season to shown strong acceleration to go with his quickness, His defensive zone presence was almost almost nonexistent. Wasn't that strong on the puck with his carries or very creative or able to make passes to his teammates that show imagination. He was a nice centre-forward in the Q, but that doesn’t necessarily project him as a  pro until he improved those parts of his game. He has and added to his game taking up the role as an agitator and guy you just don't want to play against.Still far from ready to com pete for a role as a bottom six NHLer, he is working towards that goal."
112,2016,Jacob Moverare,"Swedish defender with good size, footwork, and stick. He doesn’t wow you with high offensive attack skills, but nonetheless is a very smart and responsible defenseman. He is an excellent backward skater with good physical package. A rangy defender who maintains his gaps and seems to make good decisions on when to attack the puck carrier and when to back off. His big stick gets in the passing lane and displays smart body placement in his end. He can take or receive a puck and quick change direction and transition the puck up-ice. He skating motions a bit stiff laterally, but there’s nor denying he can quickly get where he wants. He walks the blue line on the PP attack. Has a strong point shot but it’s accuracy and placement are areas for improvement. Simply doesn't seem to have the head to help comntribute much as an attacker. A prospect you let develop his feet and attack skills, but looks like a good safe bet for the team that will do just that."
110,2016,Lucas Carlsson,"Strong 200 foot defender good speed, passing ability and plays in all situations. Not overly large, and loses many one on one battles because of it. Very calm and composed with a good head to making the right defensive plays. Has a ways to develop and has a frame that will oblige. Not a true mailman with the puck, but has some upside."
109,2016,Connor Bunnaman,"Can be viewed as a ""Christ Tierney""  type player and selection. Doesn't play PP minutes, or compile huge scoring numbers, but plays a pro-style and projects as a third line centre who slide throughout and NHL teams line-up. Smart and competitive, with excellent North-South feet, distributes the puck well on the attack, and does all the things they make forwards succesful. Very strong on his stick, and great on the wall and down low. He plays against the top teams opposing lines and he is good in his own end. Very good in the dot, and he difficult to play against and even contain. You aren't drafting him with the idea he projects as a future top six guy; just a really good driven bottom of the roster competitor who you can trust to be out there."
106,2016,Brandon Duhaime,Committed to Providence College
104,2016,Max Zimmer,"Smart and skilled American wing who just may be the best pure skater in the draft. Aggressive and causes the opposing defense to cough up the puck. His stop/starts are off the charts, and causes fits. He has committed to the University of Wisconsin."
103,2016,Todd Burgess,Committed to Rensselaer Polytechnical Institute.
102,2016,Mikhail Maltsev,"Big Russian centre who has returned from a back injury that put him on the shelf last season. He displays speed, size, skill,soft hands, a strong stride, acceleration, and top gears. Hasn’t shown elite creativity, strong decision making or on-ice vision, but that might develop. Wins the puck and is strong when he has it. He moves well laterally and shield the puck well. You can count on him to plant himself in front the net and using his big body to get opportunities."
100,2016,Victor Mete,"Undersized defenseman with great poise, decisions, feet, skill set, and offensive capabilities. He can be in his own end, avoid the forecheck turn up ice and carry or outlet it, and if he passes it he will be the four attacker on the rush in no time. If the transition back to the opposition he has the mobility and speed to still be the back in his end defending. Decent at handling most attackers one on one, boxing them out. Plays with calm and is a terrific puck mover in the offensive zone and the power play. Excellent with his decisions with the puck on the PP. Might be THE best offense man in the class. Needs to get stronger and thicker if he is going to project as an all-around pro."
111,2016,Noah Gregor,"Undersized centre-forward with great skill and ability to generate offensive. Has high end attack instincts and the ability to create on both the PP and even strength. Not the biggest guy or the strongest skater, but he has a knack for finding the the right area with his quick smart passes and shots. A player still in the developmental stage. many areas are going need to improve to continue his upward spiral.  Has a quick stick recognition skills and ability to get loose. His defensive game is a work in progress, but can't be accused of not given effort in all three zones."
97,2016,Jacob Cederholm,"The jury is still out on this lanky Swedish defender who may be further away from the finished product than most. This is a very mobile big man is in his infancy in terms of reading the play, decision-making, and establishing position of the opposition. And after all that is sorted out, a bit more edge would be nice. Plays well when he simplifies his game. A long term developmental project who could develop with work."
118,2016,Ross Colton,Committed to the University of Vermont.
99,2016,Brett Murray,"Sleeper with terrific size, good strength, and surprising skating agility. Handles the puck very well, and is not shy about using his size to get his way. His Canadians team won the CCHL championship.Has some offensive upside and scouts will give him close looks as the draft gets closer. He will grow his game at Penn State next season."
101,2016,Keaton Middleton,"Big large defender who improved his four way mobility but still needs to improve his pivots. What you see is what you get: Big man on the backline who uses his size to cover the sheet and punish opponents. He still needs to get a better feel on the offensive side decision-making. Breaks up plays with stick and getting up close and personal. He is a good puck handler and receives fast hard passes well. Speedy players will beat him, and he has to improve his choices on the attack, but there may be a reward down the road to the team that takes time growing his game."
96,2016,Linus Lindström,"Smaller framed competitor with excellent mobility, although not a true top end skater. Good hockey IQ and plays a strong two-way game. Solid PP contributor. Looks more like a set up man, but has scoring ability. Needs plenty of weight room time and bulk."
93,2016,Jack Kopacka,"Smart creative player with good puck skills, hands, a fluid stride and ability to beat defenders one on one. Needs to add edge and more strength."
94,2016,Jonathan Ang,"Has a two way game and his speed lets him pressure on the attack and support on the back-check. He is an example of a player who skates low to the ice and gets to top gear fast. His speed can cause problems to opponents. Being the fastest guy on the sheet doesn't help if you can't handle pucks, distribute them accurately or waiting too long to use your chance. It is not very helpful if you can't play to the speed you are gifted with. Needs to get bigger, thicker and stronger too."
88,2016,Connor Ingram,Western League netminder with long legs that effectively close down the bottom of the net Plays an aggressive style that has him out past the blue paint challenging shooters.
87,2016,Garrett Pilon,Improving DUB forward who you notice every shift. Has a high hockey IQ and fell. An excellent PK guy who can scorer short handed. There may be upside as he continues his upward improvement.
86,2016,Casey Fitzgerald,"Undersized offensive-minded defender with excellent jump, and quick hands. Is calm and has a strong stick and despite needing bulk and strength, he uses his lateral quickness and puck handling prowess to excel in the two way game. Committed to Boston College, but just might end up in the QMJHL in St. John."
83,2016,Wouter Peeters,"He won't turn 18 until the end of July but is playing in his third year with Red Bull Academy before planning to play in Finland next season. Last April, he convinced more than oe team that he had the athleticism size and ability to project as a possible NHL prospect. The team drafting him will probably want to come over and play in the USHL so they can work along side him to hone his game."
82,2016,Carsen Twarynski,Energy wing with good size and effort.
84,2016,Matthew Cairns,"Big quick defenseman who needs time at Cornell University to fix key flaws in his game and become of sum of many strong parts. At this juncture, he is best when he sticks to playing a strong physical game in his own end. He tries to become a puck carrier and mover and at this point lacks the vision to decide properly when to move it on, or doesn't get it to his options. College will give him an opportunity to improve his on-ice decisions."
81,2016,Sean Day,"Each player that was granted early entrance exceptional status into Canadian junior leagues are heaped with platitudes and criticized through strong microscopes. Continue up the ladder to the NHL takes a larger developmental commitment for a defensive prospect than a forward. Sean day has done little to justify he is exceptional except for gaining the tag as the most over-rated prospect in the OHL. If you are unclear on his history, his family and representation demanded he be let into the CHL early, based on his size, skating and skills coming up through Detroit’s Compuware -16 program. He has what amounts to a terrible season on and off the ice. He was sent home in December for attitude problems and requested a trade out of Mississauga. There were rumors that his camp was trying to force a trade to one specific junior team, London. The Steelheads refused to blink, and he remains their player. Despite all the ego and issues, the CHL invited him to the CHL Prospects Game. His size skills skating and shot have not rounded into a player and now have taken a backseat to the rest of his story."
85,2016,Josh Mahura," A knee injury placed him on IR for most of the season. Last season he was a guy who played both ends solid but not necessarily spectacular. Basically keeps it simple and safe, but his skating ability, hands and creativity have to get him noticed as a prospect with a much higher ceiling. A really good skater who is a long strider with the ability to second gear ago lateral on the offensive. He was just starting to show more creativeness in the attack before his got hurt. He has nice soft hands and receives passes well. Works the give and go well. Doesn’t panic in his own end and stays between attackers and his net. On the PP he sets up that half board one time with perfection. although we haven’t seen his emergence, there is lots to like about high upward mobility towards improvement."
76,2016,Rem Pitlick,Committed to the University of Minnesota.
80,2016,Brandon Gignac,"Wispy framed centre who plays on a team loaded with good players up front. This has him playing a lot less than so many of the other prospects. Not big, not strong, just super quick. Sees the on-ice situations and uses his extra gears to push back defenders, and set up his wingers. On the 2nd PP, and has shown he is a nice set-up man. He has a willingness to use his head and feet in building a 200 foot game. Not big not strong but has lots of tools to build on. He may never be able to carry a ton of extra weight on his frame, but as he continues his developmental training, he can improve his shot, and anchor."
75,2016,Jack Lafontaine,Committed to the University of Michigan.
77,2016,Connor Hall,"Solidly built showdown defenseman with good size and edge. Has good mobility and footwork, but projects as more of a stay at home defender who takes care of business protecting his teammates. Has really long arms and legs and is one of the bestl fist-fighter in the OHL. He isn't gonne join the rush, or push the pass in transition, just go back and get the puck and make the safe play out of the zone. He is best when he plays inside his comfort zone and makes those safe plays. Will get bigger and stronger."
72,2016,James Greenway,"Long-term developmental prospect who will be selected earlier than deserved based on his bloodlines and size.Has impressive physical tools and excellent feet for a big man. Thinks like an undersized offensiveman who wants to make a difference and break out and carry the length. Will need time, but there certainly are nice parts to work with."
73,2016,Joey Anderson,"Thick under six footer whose squat muscular frame moves with power and jump. Very smart on the attack and the forecheck. Throws his wide body at the enemy, and unearths pucks, and makes good reads of his teammates and gets pucks on their stick blades with precision. Doesn’t stand out as a hit end player, but just a very strong selfless complimentary attacker. Committed to the University of Minnesota- Duluth."
71,2016,Josh Anderson,"A big defender who basically handles his end and then some.  Has a nasty streak as wide as his shoulders. Has very little up ice push, but makes his end a challenge for opposing players who are looking for him as much as the puck. A steady stay home guy who logs plenty of ice time, because of his feared presence. One of the younger prospects in the class."
79,2016,Luke Green,"Mobile Q defender with dynamic feet, separation gear, and top end acceleration. Constantly pushing the pace offensively Confident puck carrier with good hands and a quick release. hits the open man on the attack. Although not the finished product in his own end, he clearly has upside to be solid there based on his four direction mobility, ability to read and react, and the physicality that he has on occasion brought along. Just scratching the surface with the tools he has to develop. Still growing and will fill out. needs to get more muscle to compete the way he does as he climbs the ladder. His draft status asa first rounded has clouded, but there is plenty of time to improve before he gets auditions for the NHL."
68,2016,Cam Dineen,An offensive defenseman who sees the ice very well and passes the puck with creativity and authority. Needs plenty of work to improve his defensive play and try a get a bit bigger and stronger. Always head up looking to make plays. Committed to Yale University.
70,2016,Will Bitten,"Lightweight speedster who is strong in his carries. His low center of gravity makes him hard to tag. Can score. Has soft, quick mitts and good IQ in the attack zone. Works hard and long on the forecheck, his size not an impediment. His set of gears and good anticipation yield many opportunities and the fact that he plays fearless in the dirty areas only makes opponents respect him more. Is committed and good with the biscuit in his own end. Doesn’t possess a big frame and is going to need weight room development to up the odds of his chances to make it. But you have to see his grit, desire and persistence as qualities that he can climb the rungs."
78,2016,Frederic Allard,"Nice puck moving defenseman with four way skating ability, good vision, foot speed, and agility. QBs the PP with good puck distribution, and no hesitation in attempts to activate into the slot when the attack calls. Can make the outlet pass well. Still has a ways to go in honing his defensive side, but long term there is a foundation to build on."
74,2016,Hudson Elynuik,Son of former NHLer Pat is huge human with emerging hockey skills.
65,2016,Vitali Abramov,"A tiny, fearless high traffic competitor with high end speed, and stick. He is listed as 5’ 9” but is small. Has terrific vision, and handles the puck with it he’s playing the shell game with you. Great hands. Handles the hard pass so well and can touch pass with the best. Piling up both goals and assists in the Q. Very unselfish player who looks for the best option even when he could shoot. Has consistently scored at even strength and on his PP chances. Can undress a defenseman and take him out of the play. Excellent touch passer and even at his diminutive size he has stood up to the rough going. It is easy to argue that part of his success is derived by the linemates he has been gifted. And easy to see how in the past many smaller offensive dynamos end up waiting until later rounds to get drafted. You have to wonder if he is the exception to that rule."
64,2016,William Lockwood,"Displays soft hands, quick moves and a persistent forecheck. Never stops flying around, and is difficult to get a bead on. Handles the puck very well at top speed, and can turn tight and separate from opponents. An under six footer with an average frame, he can be knocked of the puck, but is strong on his skates and the puck most of the time. A battler who plays fast with quick mitts."
69,2016,Cliff Pu,"Speedy playmaker who is buried lower in a superior London Knight forward lineup. Solid in most phases but has not yet taken any steps to appear to be a dominant player at this time, but NHL teams may feel he isworth a selection in the second round."
62,2016,Joseph Woll,"Missouri-born goaltender with long  arms and legs, but is still in the early stages of his development in terms of movement, instincts. Committed to Boston College."
63,2016,Markus Niemeläinen,"Rising defensive import who is very tall and rangy. He displays an active long stick, and moreover, excellent four direction skating ability.  High end hockey sense and a calm poise aid his carries, even under heavy pressure. He makes that long stretch pass very well. Has the size and feet to knock attackers off the puck, retrieve it, and get it going the other way. physical attributes. He is still adjusting to the smaller North American ice surfaces, but the ability to adjust with quick reactions, and attack and defend continue to improve with each game. The small attackers don’t really get away from him and he is intelligent when part of the attack. Still developing, with great tools and toolbox, so it may take some time, but he will caught the attention of a NHL fairly early.Played well for his home country in the Worlds U-20."
58,2016,Taylor Raddysh,"Bullish winger who goes to the battle areas. A playmaking winger with a accurate release and heavy shot. Smart and positionally sound, he has a bit of edge and decent puck skills. Displays good vision and patience in his carries. Holds until the right moment, whether it be a carry off the wall and a quick pass, or as he sees linemates getting open. Has decent balance and movement but needs to build his acceleration and stop/start quickness."
180,2018,Peter Diliberatore,Commited to Quinnipiac University.
60,2016,Dylan Gambrell,"A third year eligible centreman who can create of the rush, compete down low and in the battle areas to win pucks and set up linemates,but don’t think that he isn’t a scorer as well and a mucker. The Stocky centre has a 200 foot game and can be a grinder, scorer, power play guy or a penalty-killing specialist. Strong first step quickness and deceptive tp end gear. Supports with speed in the defensive zone and that speed causes the opposition problems in the middle zone, and when he drives to the net. Under six feet but thick and over 190 pounds already. Has a strong work ethic and commitment to play three zones, and his leg drive let him do so as he is quick in all three. he has committed to the  University  of Denver ."
67,2016,Matthew Filipe,Big Centre-forward committed to the Northeastern University.
177,2018,Liam Gorman,Committed to Boston University.
179,2018,Shawn Boudrias,"Big, tall Quebec league winger who uses his body with reckless abandon to unearth pucks and apply strong (physical in some cases) backside pressure. Possibly the youngest project in the draft class. He needs more girth, strength, and skating development to be able to improve the power in his stride. Improving his feet will make the difference to whether he is really a prospect or not. There are no complaints on his commitment on the sheet, where he works so hard for sixty minutes. Takes many a hit to make the play, and hits most moving opposition players in sight. His shot is also a work in progress."
171,2018,Nikolai Kovalenko,"Dual citizen of the US and Russia, as his father was a former physical winger Andrei Kovalenko. His son is at this point much smaller but combines a gritty edge along with high end Hockey IQ and decent feet, hand,s and skills."
168,2018,Dawson Barteaux,Later blooming defender who comes to play on a nightly basis. Displays terrific straight line speed and burst. Has gone from being considered a stay-at-home d-man to a prospect that can project as having some offensive push too -- once some footwork issues are overcome.
66,2016,Adam Fox,"Undersized defenseman who is excellent mobility an PP QB skills. Advances the puck very well because he sees the ice well. Good in transition. In the attack zone he passes the puck well towards the net. Pinches well. In his own end, he uses his feet to angle off attackers and close his gaps. The issue is his size, and whether he can advance and be successful in the higher levels of play. He has commited to Harvard University."
164,2018,Michael Kesselring,Committed To Merrimack College.
162,2018,Alexis Gravel,He was viewed as the top Q goalie based on is height and long range projection. So far he is pegged as an even longer developmental prospect as his game has not progressed as quickly as hoped.
158,2018,David Tendeck ,"Acrobatic battling goalie who is very thin and ""only"" two inches over six foot. Aggressively challenges shooters, has a terrific glove, and  moves in all directions very quickly."
157,2018,Kevin Mandolese,Big goaler who fills the crease with a good glove and decent athleticism. Reads attacks well and shows strong understanding and implementation  of the technical aspects of his position. Doesn’t waste motion and is a battler in the “home plate area.” Needs to develop rebound control further and fine tune his shot challenge. Has shown moxie and mental toughness on a poor defensive club. Long term development guy with some tools and positive attitude.
154,2018,Connor Corcoran,Nicely sized defender who vastly improved by the end of the year due to more ice time and bigger responsibilities.
167,2018,Mathias Emilio Pettersen,Committed to Denver University.
174,2018,Gavin Hain,Committed to the University of North Dakota.
153,2018,Giovanni Vallati,"Good playmaking defender with a bit of physicality, and a willingness to push on attackers. Pivots well to the back pedal, funnels attackers to the outside. He needs to get stronger to take on opponents and must read and react better so his passes aren’t anticipated. He is a good puck handler who makes sound exits in transition when he has time. Currently a pass- first type player and he needs to start letting it go so opponents must think he might not pass on some plays."
151,2018,Vladislav Yeryomenko,Member of Belarus' World Junuior U-20 team.
155,2018,Damien Giroux,Hard working 200 foot energy wing who can score from around the net. Plays on both penalty kill and power play.  Skates very well and has deceptive a burst. Is good when he doesn't have the puck. Strong forechecker and a good set up man on the zone entry. His size drops him back in the pack.
148,2018,Simon Johansson,Second year eligible offensive defender who has lingered as a Swedish junior league player because he is a work in progress in his own end.
149,2018,Filip Král ,Six foot Czech import defenseman who is still learning the North American game. Has good vision and good puck moving ability and good touch on his passes. Good outlet passer on transitions who can thread the needle on the home run blue line pass or short saucers to his closer teammates.  Usually makes the correct  pass coming out and also is a willing carrier up ice. Needs to improve his quickness/reaction times when bad things happen. Loses pucks or erant passes against speedsters/forecheckers. Will need to be quicker in his decision making as he climbs the ladder to higher competition levels.
142,2018,Michael Callahan,Committed to Providence.
150,2018,Declan Chisholm,Good offensive skills but his defensive end is a work in progress.
144,2018,David Hrenak,Commited to St. Cloud State University.
137,2018,Riley Damiani,"Well rounded player who is simply a lightweight and doesn't have high-end attributes that helps him gain an upper hand. He had a good junior playoff, but lots of developing must happen to become a solid pro player."
139,2018,Mikail Hakkarainen,Committed to Providence College.
131,2018,Spencer Stastney ,Committed to the University of Notre Dame.
130,2018,Toni Utunen,"Small framed defender who is a solid teammate, leader, and plays a smart, responsible game in all phases on the ice."
128,2018,Cole Fonstad,"Undersized compact prospect from an athletic family. Never stops impressing upon his observers that he plays 200 feet the entire night without letting up. Displays a really nice first step and terrific edge control. That allows him to patiently slip into seams, stop start on a dime, skate to passes, and surprise in the scoring areas. Not the fastest skater, but has a good pace every shift. Really good shooter on the move, and very good at handling the puck in small spaces. High energy motor, diagnoses, and with his compact stride - catches teams whether he shoots or makes pass that they don’t expect. His recognition of where his linemates will be and his slippery demeanor make every pound difficult to contend with."
129,2018,Justin Almeida,One of the better second year eligibles is a heavy traffic area scorer-checker with improved offensive skills by adding strength to his stride and and an extra step. Displays the developing characteristics that propel mid-rounders to becoming solid NHL contributors.
134,2018,Blade Jenkins,"Big centre-forward from the USA developmental program with a high skill set. Displays good vision and can go around defenders turning the corner to the slot area. Probably is more suited as a winger, utilizing his quickness and strength. Has shown some jam down low in the scoring areas but needs to be more competitive and aggressively get pucks on the forecheck. Looks like a future left wing as he progresses and adds intensity and defensive awareness."
124,2018,Mitchell Gibson,"Second year eligible developing right handed defender. Needs time and college will bring that. Really good power play player, and can QB with the best of them. Will get up and go with the puck on breakouts and although in need of refinement in his end, has a good positioning and decision making in his own end. Committed to Harvard University."
127,2018,Wyatte Wylie,"Was  switched back over to his natural right side after starting the year on the left side. Made strides in his play, confidence, in the playoff, and increased physicality. Started to show offensive upside and taking the puck down low to shoot more."
126,2018,Angus Crookshank,Whirling dervish with great feet and compete level. Committed to the University of New Hampshire.
123,2018,Jack Gorniak,Committed to the University of Wisconsin.
122,2018,Milos Roman,"Speedy centre-forward with a terrific first step, good stick, and puck handling prowess. It is difficult to move him off the puck when he is working down low. A dynamic tracking force on offense and aggressive forechecker who unearths pucks. Was slowed by ankle injury he incurred at the World Junior U-20. His downside is he isn’t interested in hard battles for pucks on the wall or traffic. He isn’t timid, just leery."
120,2018,Philipp Kurashev,"Smart slick puck-handling centre with decent speed and East-West lateral agility. High hockey IQ and creative instincts as a passer. Sees and anticipates developing plays. Far from ready to be considered NHL worthy, as he has zero interest in getting dirty in physical games. But you cannot argue that he isn't a fine playmaker despite his lack of any grittiness or edge at this juncture.  Needs plenty of work in the face-off circle, but I can see him as winger in his present playing style."
119,2018,Curtis Hall,Has a decent all-around game but has flat-lined after a strong 2016-17 rookie campaign in the USHL. High skill set and good feet. Offensive savvy but didn't seem to progress and hold onto the dominant/dynamic evaluations expected. Dual US-Canada citizenship. Committed to Yale University.
118,2018,Mac Hollowell,"Small, thin, puck-moving defender."
115,2018,Paul Cotter,Versatile centre-wing who comes ready to play and displays a quick hard release. Good mix of skill and speed mixed with a high level of grittiness and a willingness to get the things done to win. A year ago he won the NAHL Rookie of the Year honors. Committed to Western Michigan University.
117,2018,Linus Lindstrand Kronholm,"Big, raw, defensively solid, edgy defender who has seems to have gotten lost in the pile of high-end Swedish defensemen. Makes a hard first pass out of his end. No flash, just a really strong on his skates player who is really solid in his own end. Blocks shots, clears the front, and plays the body with regularity and some snarl. Is starting to show progress as an offensive zone player displaying a cannon from the back end. Has shown more confidence in jumping up in the play. Is more than willing to be a total team guy and stand up for his teammates. A sleeper who might surprise."
56,2016,Dillon Dubé,"Undersized forward from an athletic family who is a great skater, excellent on I’ve vision , and shoots the puck very well. One of Kelowna’s key guys when they are killing  a penalty, he is a shot blocker, and can transition those blocks in to short-handed breakaways. In the attack zone, he uses his feet and  and to get behind the defenders. Has a high level hockey IQ, a really good face-off man, vision, and plenty of playmaking ability.  Gets right in on the forecheck, and when he takes the puck away, walks out to the front, and can quickly snap his wrist shot on net. Really strong on the puck down low and on the wall. Has a touch pass. His separation gear causes problems in so many parts of the attack zone. Fast enough to split the defense, get around from the outside, or bust into an open area quicker than expected. Plays like a larger guy in the battle areas and surprises big players when he outmuscles them. Longer term development is needed, but no coach will say he doesn’t leave it all out there."
116,2018,Jack Perbix,Committed to the University of Notre Dame.
57,2016,Carl Grundström,"A edgy team first player who finished 4th in the World Junior Tourney scoring. A good balanced skater who is tough to knock off the puck and crashes and drives to the paint. The opposition doesn’t like him, and he manages to rile the opponents with his nastiness. Has a strong sense of the play and reads the ice well during his penalty killing duties. Has a nice touch with the puck and good stick skills shows good touch with precise passes in traffic. Very opportunistic, and has good enough feet to get separation on defenders. May be seen as a 3rd line player with good skills,vision and edge who drives hard North-South and plays a physical."
55,2016,Filip Gustavsson,"This right shooting goaler may possibly the best net minder prospect out of Sweden, he followed a shaky Swedish league start with an excellent World Junior as an integral component in most of the wins. Positionally strong, he keep movement to a minimum letting things come to him. Good going side to side, squares up on shooters, and is an athletic battler in the opposition gets to the net. Can over-commit, and still needs to build his game. As is the case with many Euro goalies, he plays a bit to deep in the net."
54,2016,Tyler Parsons,"It’s easy to say he is what he is because of the London Knight team in front of him, but he is a difference maker with key saves in most games."
51,2016,Kale Clague,"Poised puck hander with good vision, hockey sense, and offensive instincts. A strong transition player who has excellent four direction mobility and elite straight ahead acceleration. Displays good composure and is solid in his end at the junior level and stays home until he is sure he can join in on the attack. His feet aid not only his gap control, but let him burst in and disrupt their entrances. Gets his stick out and breaks up the passing lanes in opposition attacks. He is a good outlet passer in transition, able to get out of tight spaces and can jump up and join the attack and tear through the opposition neutral zone positioning. Terrific one timer, and a no-look pass/shot that is never telegraphed. Excellent touch passer and he can barrel across the blue line, fake a shot, and glide in closer for an even better one. Can get caught down low when he activates, but I can’t think of any NHL club that will have concerns about his size or long range upside."
49,2016,Ryan Lindgren,"American born defender with good feet and a solid two way game. Not tall, but solidly built, he displays poise in his own end and smarts with, or without the puck. His four direction skating ability gives him an advantage as both a defender (who can handle one on ones and retrieve the quick dump-ins rapidly) and as an attacker (who can smartly read his options, and make astute decisions as a passer or carrier). A solid six footer who has a bit of an edge to go along with the top flight acceleration, nice vision, and an active stick when defending. He is good with the puck in the attack zone and has a good point shot. Very calm and decisive when on the ice, and always seems to make the smart play in all zones. Committed to the University of Minnesota."
52,2016,Wade Allison,Big winger with good speed and upward trending season's end. Committed to Western Michigan University.
50,2016,Artur Kayumov,"High speed up-tempo skter who is very shifty and can make plays at top speed. Easily gets separation and generates chances for his teammates. Sees the ice well and has soft hands. Very slight and far from ready. looks like a player a team selects and brings over to the CHL and watches to see if he can develop, get better and develop into a North American wing who actually works the wall and wins puck battles in the battle areas. Right now, he doesn't."
48,2016,Carter Hart,"Projects as one of the top goalers in the class. An confident goalie who is agile and flexible, and possesses a super-quick glove. Has the ability to swing momentum in his team’s favor. Squares up on shooters and is quick going post to post. Displays good rebound control, excellent reaction time, flexibility and flattens very low in the butterfly. Teams will be concerned if he is going grow bigger than his present six foot. His glove, reflexes, and quick pads are what's got him this far."
46,2016,Givani Smith,"Centre-forward with size, skating ability and plays an aggressive take the puck back style. He is at his bests goes to the front and plays tough. Projects as a NHL bottom six role player, and has a bit more skill than some would believe."
47,2016,Samuel Girard,"Small Q defender who consistently shows he can be a top junior defender despite his lack of girth and height. An instinctive offense generator who four direction skating and light edging make him a player. An excellent PP QB with a heavy shot good hands and lateral agility. Instinctive in both ends. Gets open on the track and as an outlet for his defensive partner. His feet help him to close on defenders in his end. He is difficult to line up and hit because he keeps moving and is low, and posing off them. The question becomes how small can an NHL defender be? The Wild’s Jared Sprugeon lasted until the 6th round, only to have the team that drafted him, the Islanders, decide two years later to not sign him. He has solidified spot on the Minnesota backline. Clearly a terrific developmental player albeit one of a smaller variety. He led ALL Canadian Major junior defenseman in scoring this season and a point for game in the post season."
45,2016,Chad Krys,"A puck carrying defenseman who is a tad undersized and whose game strength is great offensive instincts and superior skating. Explosive bursts in his carries and loves to activate. Displays a precise outlet pass in transition. Is still a work in progress and a defender. Needs long term development to learn to play the defensive part of defenseman. Gets lost and even the quick feet don't help, when he can't seem to be in a position to defend. He is committed to Boston University where he can hone his game."
43,2016,Janne Kuokkanen,"Fluid long strider who can play a high paced game with skill and creativity. Has impressive offensive capabilities and his ability to make quick decisions is why he verbally runs his teams power play. Versatile enough to play all three forward positions with excellent understanding, agility, and vision. Makes quick decisions. Finds open ice, utilizes his feet and stick to deke opponents , and use his soft hands to give and receive back the puck. Not a speed demon or a player with a heavy shot; just one who can use his quickness, vision, and finesse to make plays. He is good in puck pursuit. He has a fast release. Not a wall guy or one that engages much physically. Not strong on the wall or on the puck in confrontations, mostly because he simply isn’t developed enough physically to be one. Long term developmental prospect."
44,2016,Boris Katchouk,"Meat and potatoes winger whose game involves strong physical combat with opposing players, and solid forecheck, strong work ethic, a deceptively hard accurate shot, and quick feet. Strong in puck pursuit and strong on the forecheck. Actully has pretty soft hands. Maybe the difference in selecting a player with high end upside and Katchouk, is he is going already be suited for growing in to a role as a checking winger as he climbs the ladder to higher levels of play. Disruptive and aggressive in keeping possession, there is no question that he has skills, nose for the net, skating ability, edge and the willingness to be an involved player for sixty minutes. And that might count for more than higher end abilities and no taste for the playing for and against “heavy game” players. Has dual Canadian and Russian citizenship."
41,2016,Nathan Bastien,Quiet and effective big centre/wing who takes care of 200 feet efficiently. Strong and smart competitor who can put the puck on a teammates stick or let it go. Thrives in the middle zone with his sound defensive coverage and is very good in his own end too. May be will suited for a switch to wing as a pro. Spent much of the season on the wing with Nylander and Centre McLeod.When he makes contact he usually leaves an impression. A developing prospect whose feet will improve as he develops and who checks boxes when you examine all the things he does well.
42,2016,Jonathan Dahlén,Son of Ulf.
39,2016,Alex DeBrincat,"Hampered by the graduation of his former linemans Conor McDavid  and Dylan Strome , the diminutive DeBrincat’s production dropped…to a goal a game pace."
40,2016,Cameron Morrison,Big skilled winger who a rookie in the USHL.Committed to the University of Notre Dame.
36,2016,Pascal Laberge,"He wowed all with his opportunistic goal scoring in the Prospects game.Quick, agile forward with terrific stop/starts, change of direction and solid offensive instincts which make him dangerous in many ways in the attack zone. Decisively attacks with quick shots, passes, and even uses the enemy goaler’s pads to generate rebounds. A character individual who has handled real life adversity in the lats years, as he has had to carry the heavy emotion load of family sicknesses and losses. Plays quick. He is a work in progress as he needs to add weight and muscle to his 160 pound frame."
35,2016,Jordan Kyrou,"A speed and energy centre-wing who has a good two way junior game, good one on one skills, and goes in looking for pucks. He is strong on hos pins and difficult to contain. Releases the puck quickly with a pair of soft hands, and can play strong on the stick when he has the biscuit. Has displayed some good work in small areas and stuck out in the U-18 tourney as one of the best players. But there is a lack of consistency in his ability to score it may just be a matter of the prospect getting stronger and being able to physically win with regularity. Not really big or physical, not really overly skilled, and it is questionable if he can fill in the blanks in either area to ensure he could be a top six NHLers. Long term developmental prospect who could be a late bloomer."
34,2016,Andrew Peeke,Right hander deeman who plays with an air of calm and smarts. hHas size and good mobility  and is a reliable three zone player. Strong into his pivots and backward stride. Has a good point shot and plays with some competitiveness although you would like to see a bit more snarl to his game. Committed to the  University of Notre Dame.
37,2016,Libor Hájek,"Aggressive mobile dee-man with decent skills and can move the puck offensively. Strong and thick-bodied. Plays with good intensity and awareness. Takes the body, pins/seals on the wall and wins puck battles. Has a long stick and is decisive when advancing the puck. His skating is high end; excellent in his stop/starts, and his first steps. Light on his edges and very aware of positioning in his end. A good passer and despite being new to the North American ice surface, has shown much to like in his first year."
53,2016,Filip Hronek,Czech Republic defender who displayed terrific puck moving skills and instincts. runs the PP and reads and dishes well. Not big but plays well in all phases unnoticed. Plays aggressive and doesn't really panic under pressure. Positionally solid in all three zones. Has good vision and sees his outlet options and hits them. Likes to carry with good feet and isn't afraid of the rough going. Not six foopt but an interesting prospect who will needs more weight room to get stronger in body and stride.
29,2016,Trent Frederic," Centre with good size who plays strong on the puck and good puckhandling skills.  More of a North-South straight line skater with little lateral mobility. Displays a very good shot, with nice release. He might project as a future left wing, but he really needs to add to his offensive game and add more creativeness to his attacking skills. Drafted by OHL's Niagara. He has committed to the University of Wisconsin and he may hone his offensive side there."
33,2016,Rasmus Asplund,"Played in the 5 Nations Tourney 2014 and was a member of his homeland’s team roster for the World Junior Under-20 at Christmas 2014. Slightly built centre wing who has great hands and commitment to improving his two way game. Displays good speed, hands, and Hockey IQ.  Not the biggest body, but is strong forechecker who win puck battles. A playmaker with creativity and good vision who plays big. With William Nylander’s World Junior Tourney injury, he played in his spot. Works hard in his own end, using his body and stick in lanes to take away opportunities by getting back quickly. He sees and reads the ice well and brings his teammate support by drawing attackers his way making space for them. His anticipation,nose for the net, and good hockey sense make his a player who can slide up and down the forward lines, and that will fall in his favor when draft time calls. His size may be a factor in where he is taken. Must continue to make his linemates better plays and continue improving his 200 foot game."
32,2016,Tyler Benson,"His Bantam and Midget resume tell of a consistent scorer/generator with a strong physical game. So far he has been asked to be an all situation player with the Giants, and hasn’t disappointed. Big bodied left wing with physicality and edginess. Displays a strong defensive game, hockey IQ, a nice skill set, and does all things at an above average levels.  And although he has a choppy stride, he is powerful and coupled with his high-end stickhandling skills and size, he fearless competes down low and in all the battle areas. Good on the cycle. An excellent passer and his precise shot and release are also high-end, although his assist totals surpass his goals. Usually the unprecise art of scout attempts to look at the entire canvass starting with the early age years and the question is asked is the prospects continuing to improve on his scoring, abilities and can he be projected as a player who will continue in improving ensuring a role on an NHL club whether it be top six or bottom six. The point is to project that you are drafting a player who eventually makes your parent club. I think that if his goal totals were a bit higher, there would be no questions that he makes the grade. I think his goal totals with continue upward and his development is far from over."
30,2016,Sam Steel,"Yet another under six footer with high end speed, excellent vision, touch, and strong work ethic. Despite being a tad undersized he is fearless along the wall and never hesitant to stickhandle in traffic areas or along the wall. Has a superior shot but his elite passing skills are what butters his bread. He is not a passenger; he works hard to take pucks back and on offense. He has a high end understanding of using motion in the attack zone. He finds the creases, and lures defender to him. His quickness and ability to play so strong on the puck opens space for his teammates. Needs to continue getting stronger and further improving his legs to where he has a true separation gear. Uses his speed as a weapon against the opposition breakouts. If he continues his improvement he may end up and NHL top six player maybe even progress to the high expectations many expected him to prior to this season."
27,2016,Brett Howden,"Big strong centre-left wing who sets up shop in front and feeds of deflections and rebounds. Not a flashy player, just an load to move who plays all 200 feet. He has gradually improved his defensive zone work, and his overall game. Smart player who skates well with good balance. Has a strong and effective shot, and works the give and go very effectively. Is strong on the puck, and uses his reach and size to win puck battles in the greasy areas. He sees the ice well."
25,2016,Riley Tufte,"An enormous wing who was the standout player in the United States All-American Prospects game. He has the skills and acceleration that you see in much smaller forwards. Has a very fast game, eg. he moves and acts at a quick pace, and his huge size makes him almost unstoppable, as he can stickhandle in smaller spaces and in a smooth motion take off on the opposition with a power move to the net. Plays hard and will stand in the crease area like an unmovable object. Is good on the entire sheet. He supports the defenseman and is known to dig pucks out of his own end. He’s a Mack truck when he wants to go to the front and has been known to carry defenders along. Certainly not the finished product and there is always the level of competition that you have to weigh against the eyeball test, but you can’t deny the dynamic combination of skill, speed, size, soft hands, reach and quick release that is there. If only he was a little more belligerent, and more difficult to play against. Committed to the University of Minnesota-Duluth."
23,2016,Henrik Borgström,"Second year eligible Finnish centre is big slick stick-handler who needs to work to further strengthen his lower body in order to add power and speed to his skating. He has good skills and vision, but little consistency. Needs to be better away from the puck, and continue to grow his offensive side.  Displays some really good dangle in his possession skills but has trouble deciding what the read is and can look bad when things go south in transistion. Committed to Denver University where the team who selects him will expect to see upside."
28,2016,Lucas Johansen,"Emerging defender who projects as a two way defender with strong balance and skating ability. The younger brother of Ryan is still a work in progress, but has size and is a very good puck mover and plays on both the penalty kill and the power play. Leads by example and can move attacker out of the front,  get in the lanes and break up passes, and he make that first pass out in transition and jump into the rush. Displays a very good point shot. Will play the body, but if he added a bit more aggression, he make it more difficult to play against him. Needs to get thicker and add weight and muscle."
26,2016,Tage Thompson,"Huge developmental winger from Long Island who needs more leg strength so he can get to the spots to use his size. Needs  to develop his hockey instincts along with his skills and feet. For a huge specimen, doesn't make enough use of it. Doesn't read the attack well, or at this juncture, have the jump to stay in the play at both ends. Scored from deflections in front, and on the PP, where there was space. He will need to actually develop over the course of more than a few college seasons to show possibilities as a NHL- level contributor."
21,2016,Julien Gauthier,"Big winger with a strong fluid with a terrific shot and release. He uses his body to take pucks away, and win possession battles in the offensive zone. A big man with soft hands, a great one-timer and a willingness to go in the dirty areas and in the front. He can change gears and surprise defenders by beating them off the wing. Q defenders get caught in denial thinking no way can a guy this big be that explosive. Needs to develop more as a play-maker, and get pucks to his linemates as well as they feed him. He is a a North-South skater who depends upon his linemates to get him the puck. His game needs rounding out, but looks like an excellent prospect."
24,2016,Max Jones,"Big aggressive winger who plays a passionate high energy aggressive style. Has a strong powerful stride. Is more of a North-South skater who bulls his way through to wherever he is going and crash and bangs. Has a strong shot that packs some wallop, but there is also wallop when he drops’em. He is know to stick up for teammates and gets them more space because of it. In short space he will accelerate and meet opponents on the wall or in the paint. Has a heavy quick shot that needs to gain more accuracy. He is known to catch opponents with big open ice checks. Displays high character along with toughness, size and feisty 200 foot game. A streaky scorer and the jury is out as to whether he can contribute heavily in that aspect. Plays like an old fashion grinder, who may gain more consistency as a finisher as he develops. But he may end up as a checker who can chip in a goal here or there."
19,2016,Keiffer Bellows,"Son of Brian is a hard driving power player who also has skill. Has size and gains advantage when he puts it to use. He is strong on the puck, shows a separation gear. Plays passionately ands on occasion gotten edgy."
18,2016,Logan Stanley," Giant defensemen with a great reach, and decent mobility for a youngster this size.Has an active stick and his length lets him close gaps, and Is exceedingly calm under pressure and despite the need to get stronger and bigger, he doesn't wilt in his defensive zone. Clearly needs quicker stop/starts and better acceleration, but most assuredly an NHL team or two will consider selecting him and letting him develop further."
17,2016,Dante Fabbro,"An average framed prospect with a terrific all-around game. His bread and butter is strong feet and four-direction mobility coupled with high hockey IQ puck skills. Poised mailman who doesn’t seem to feel pressure and easily eludes forecheckers. Slick defender whose PP QB skills are excellent. Very creative with the puck on the attack and a very strong skater who can spin off pressure. Has great vision and can thread the needle on the long home run break-outs. Can find the seam and put the puck up ice in transition with regularity. His feet and puck skills help him break up passes, and be an excellent penalty killer. Very confident and fluid in all three zones."
22,2016,German Rubtsov,"Complete two-way performer with excellent size, skill and skating ability. His performance in the World Junior Challenge may have cemented his first round status. In that mid December tourney he seemed to single-handedly take apart the U.S. entry in all outcomes and all phases with his domination. Plays like it is his last game ever. Has really good size and East-West mobility which he uses in puck pursuit to get it back and get things going again. This big strong horse can force defenders backward and his ability to play strong on the puck has him holding it while teammates are able to find the soft spots. Opposing players tried to knock him off the puck but he keeps control and eventually goes to the net. If the seam closes, he with keep moving in possession until a teammate’s chance opens up. Walks out of the corners in control and hungry. Yet is difficult to project where Russian who are not playing in North America are slotted by the NHL staffs. 	Forward Denis Gurianov and goaler Ilya Samsonov went early in the first, but no other Russian went to mid-third round. It might be safe to say Rubtsov goes somewhere later than Samsonov and before the third round."
16,2016,Jacob Chychrun,"Each player that was granted early entrance exceptional status into Canadian junior leagues is heaped with platitudes and criticized through strong microscopes. Continue up the ladder to the NHL takes a larger developmental commitment for a defensive  prospect than a forward. The son of former NHL player, Jeff, plays with a calm demeanor, good feet, lateral agility and physicality. An elite defensive prospect with a tremendous package of talent. Already physically developed, he is a terrific skater with a separation gear, and a hard cutting stride and  a skating base that lets him protect the puck.  Possesses a strong wrist shot and is able to stickhandle with precision and accuracy through traffic. He is polished two way player with good feet, strong skills but needs to continue to hone the defensive side of his game. Already plays with an edge. With physicality in place he needs to continue maturing in his positional play. It will determine if he evolves to a impact pro or simply a good one. His puck smarts and passing ability see him as a future NHL PP guy too."
14,2016,Charles McAvoy,"Young Boston U. defender whose past USNTDP Juniors resume might typecast his as push the pace offenseman. But he shows smarts, good decisions and consistent defensive game as well. A thick six footer (still growing) with a muscular frame that handles the older college opponents well. Displays quick feet and excellent decision-making and assertiveness on his touches. Processes and acts . Smart without the puck. Ties attackers on the wall, and displays good positioning. In transition he makes the quick first pass and and stays with the play sometimes joining into the rush. Can handle the PP QB role. Has a strong hard shot. Distributes the puck well and has heavy shot. Still needs improvement in footwork; gets into trouble when he is unable to pivot and move backward on opponent’s when they are making a push into his defensive zone. Injuries to the BU veteran defensive core called for him to get an early baptism with significant playing time in key situations. Still a work in progress, and needs to improve his puck decisions and tone down his riverboat gambler style of playing the back end. Despite the warts his potential has the 18 year old is rising up the draft lists."
13,2016,Jake Bean,"One of the youngest players in the class. Might be the best puck distributor in the class of defenseman. Coupled with his nice long skating stride and great edging, he can gain separation with stops and starts, but alway thinking far ahead with where he is making a play with the puck. His great passing gets him out of trouble in his own end. Sees a lane open and gets the puck to his man."
10,2016,Tyson Jost,"Shifty centre with impressive feet and stickhandling ability. Can stickhandle in a phonebooth. A team leader who on the ice and in the room. Great vision and recognition in the offensive end, so he spreads away from teammates and then pinpoint passes to their sticks on the give and go. A terrific finisher with a great shot.  Disciplined worker hin his own zone. Wins puck battles and turns them into chances. He knows where to place himself so that the puck can find him. Makes his teammates better. Not the finished product and needs more lower body strength and muscle. He has committed to the University of North Dakota."
12,2016,Michael McLeod,"A centre who wants the puck on his stick. He drives the net with reckless abandon. Strong hands, great feet and body position lets him turn the corner wide on defenders. Relentless and determined in puck pursuit. Has great edging and keeps the pins going in all phases of the play. A terrific passer who puts it on his linemates sticks while in stride. Sees the ice well and has game breaking ability. Soft hands and a strong wrist shot and release, and its will improve as he gets more muscle. A big playmaking centre who can take a game over with his dominant speed.Will need to fill out, but looks like a top prospect."
11,2016,Logan Brown,"Son of former NHLer Jeff Brown towers over the potential first round draft class at six foot five inches plus. He effectively uses his reach on the forecheck and to keep the puck away from the opposition. Besides having excellent vision and hockey sense, he is a above average stickhandler who handles the puck well. His size enables him to win puck battles and although his skating style is awkward, it is effective enough to help him gracefully moves into areas to create space  and open teammates. He has a decent shot which he needs to improve and actually use more frequently. Very effective down low, and holds onto pucks by using his size and reach, and is difficult to contain. He never looks out of place no matter what pace the game is moving at. He needs to shot more. he needs actually get more involved. I think observers tend to view big men like him as less urgent and a passenger. And we all want our big forwards to play hard and aggressive. He projects to be a NHL power scoring wing but to actually develop into that prototypical power forward he needs a few parts to his game."
8,2016,Alexander Nylander,"Brother of William and son of Micheal is a speedy offensive wing with a high skill set, great vision and excellent offensive instincts. I went into this season thinking of him as I do many hockey siblings - same bloodline but far less talent. My opinion was based on his awkward skating stride and lack of speed. He had high-end offensive instincts, exceptionally soft hands and puck handling skills, but just didn’t display the wheels to complete the portrait. He must have committed to improving his feet and has clearly shown he can generate the attack and make teammates better. He may never reach his brother skill set, but is unselfish to a fault, and strong competitor. He has a really quick shot, but his soft hands make him a brilliant set up artist. He generates chances because he reads situations well, and quickly reacts with precise passes through traffic. As a scorer, he will raise you from your seat with his accurate blistering shot. When his team has possession in the offensive zone, he will find the crack of open space in coverage and surprise with an accurate shot of the pass. His new found quick feet and balance add to his agility and stop/start ability. He always was good East-West who was ultra shifty with the puck. He is now quicker, more dynamic and possible the most skilled player in the draft."
7,2016,Clayton Keller,"Smaller with a high skill set. A high speed player who acquires pucks and can generate chances for linemates almost instantaneously. Has seen time of the PK besides the PP. he is agile and the high level at which he can control the puck at top speed is a joy to watch. On his carries, he can go from the perimeter to the greasy areas and see his options and make plays. Has an excellent release and shot. Both confident and patient with the biscuit."
6,2016,Matthew Tkachuk,"His bloodlines might be a clue to why he is an edgy high energy winger with offensive upside. Leads by example, shift after shift, never taking one off. He is the grease that make the line he is on go. Will hustle back and break up a pass in the defensive zone. Win all the battles in the dirty areas. Goaltenders are acquainted with him because he comes by frequently. He is always winning battles down low, and along the wall with hits contact, and disruption. Runs into the defensive player in the quest for the puck. He is ready and willing to line up at any of the forward positions with authority. has a nice release and heavy shot. A load to contend with when he goes to the net. Can come out of the corner with a defender on his back and still make a play with a pass or disrupting the front. Sure there are players in the class that advanced as scorers, but they can’t match him 60 minute intensity. Still a work in progress, who doesn’t necessarily jump out as dominant scorer, just a winner."
20,2016,Dennis Cholowski,"Four way skating defender who has seemed to go from a tiny midget defenseman into a six foot elite skating offenseman. Calm, confident and aware from his end all the way up to the attack zone. Plays on both the PK and the PP where his vision and elusiveness already make him a strong competitor. He will continue to work on strengthening his shot and over all physicality in the weight room. He started at 5’ 8” and projects to be 6’ 3”."
5,2016,Olli Juolevi,"Finnish import defenseman with a good frame and excellent offensive instincts. Displays significant upside as prospect who can eventually be a two way defender. Maintain good gaps and has an active stick. An excellent stickhandler who can be very poised with the puck. Is athletic and mobile and reads the ice well. Is a crisp long distance passer in transition and can also carry the mail out of the zone. Not adverse to going the rush, is an excellent PP QB, and has a strong hard point shot along with a long range writs shot. Very fluid and has a great feel for the offensive end. Has some physicality and will tie opponents on the wall.It is difficult to estimate exactly where he gets selected in the first round. There are plenty of reasons teams would value his vision and instinct in the attacking part of the game, but if you ask scouts which parts of junior defense’s games are most important, backward skating and handling the defensive part of the game rank rank high. He has trouble handling quicker forwards in his end, and also gets out-muscled in the dirty areas, along the wall and when in possession. He needs to get harder on the stick. These are parts of the game that can be improved upon and he does have a some bite to his game, so he is a pretty nice defensive prospect even with the parts he needs to develop."
2,2016,Patrik Laine,"One-third of the World Junior Champion Finnish teams top line. Already playing in the Finnish Elite League, he is a huge skilled wing whose on-ice instincts make him dangerous offensively. Combine his giant frame with a hungry compete level, solid hockey instincts, a long reach and his accurate and quick release and you see what scouts are excited about. He still needs to improve his boots, but the talent is there. He is an excellent puck possession player who can control the pace. At his 6' 4"" size comes with terrific use of his reach and body to involve himself in the attack. Big guys with puck possession skills are difficult to find. He has a good head for reading the offensive zone attack, and has shown  high level scoring touch that might lead to and even stronger upside down the road as he grows into his frame."
15,2016,Luke Kunin,"Rising offensive centreman with a strong stride and excellent lateral mobility. The bulb went on and he is make himself know every shift. If he doesn’t have the puck, he uses his agility to get it on the forecheck. Can causes opposing defensemen to have fits when he quickly charges in forcing plays. Has strong offense skills as a scorer and set up man. Displays vision and can create problems with his carries and passes. Has a good shot, but his value starts with hard forecheck, defensive responsible and relentless activity as an offensive generator and pursuer. A true Freshman who will only improve with more work."
1,2016,Auston Matthews,"San Francisco born, Arizona-raised forward who has size, speed and scoring ability and has displayed it since he was 16 years of age with dominant performances against older juniors. Uses his size and smarts to dominate. If he had been born two days earlier, he would have been the third selection in 2015. A mature player who displays a high skill set, powerful skating feet, and a bigger frame that allows him to make space and breach the offensive zone. Defensively responsible. The NHL players he has scrimmaged with have took notice of his puck-handling, passing, shot and possession skills. He isn’t much an aggressive edging player, but uses his size much like Jonathan Toews uses his size to game advantage. Has played centre and can also easily be projected as a right wing. Clearly appears to be the most NHL-ready of the class due to on & off ice regime, mature attitude to go with a man’s size, high hockey IQ and polished skill set."
0,2019,Cooper Moore,Committed to the Uiniversity of North Dakota..
9,2016,Mikhail Sergachyov,"Big tough mobile import defenseman playing in the OHL with a strong heavy point shot. A difficult player to beat one on one because he possesses a strong stride and excellent East-West lateral mobility. Relishes been able to get a big check in on opponents both along the boards and in open-ice. Has good vision and in transition makes good home run outlet passes. And although he on occasion will hold on to pucks a bit long, or get careless in his carries, he displays good passing skills. When you see a junior defender with this size ,mobility mixed with a dose of nasty, you have to think he goes off the board early no matter how much the pro game is evolving"
4,2016,Jesse Puljujärvi,"Top true Euro forward in the 2015 class is a Finn born in Sweden who has been playing in the  Finnish elite league since he was 16. Elite size, speed and shot. Uses his size to out-muscle opponents and has a deadly shot he is unafraid to use repeatedly. Some would argue that being scoring leader at the World Junior Tourney was a coming out party but he has established himself as a strong player in most phases of the game in the Finnish Pro league. Paired with Patrik Laine as bookend wings for his regular centre in Kärpät , Sebastian Aho, both solidified their status as early selections. I have him with on edge of Laine based on how strong a finisher Puljujärvi is down low. Jesse is a very strong skater and although doesn't appear as a dominant scoring threat shift after shift, he gets his chances and moreover he makes his line one that it is difficult to get scoring chances on. He stays involved shift after shift: He acts as a huge screen. He has terrific hands and a attack zone work tools, including an explosive burst, and smart two-way game. Still not as fluid or as offensively polished to challenge as the draft's top forward, but this RW has abilities that project him to turn into an excellent pro."
0,2019,Eric Ciccolini,Committed to the University of of Michigan.
3,2016,Pierre-Luc Dubois,"Came into the season after have success as a intense wing who had good size, hockey sense, and composure. He was strong on the cycle, a terrific competitor, and a frame that could easily fit more muscle and girth. He had all the makings of a first round pick at wing. The move to centre has given him more freedom to be creative in the attack zone and he still plays a reliable defensive game. Can be equally effective at setting up plays and scoring. Had the Tampa Lightning’s strength coach Mark Lambert teach his a pro strength regime. Part of the reasoning behind it he is not a blazing skater and needs a bit more explosiveness in his leg strength. He also is getting a leg up on adding muscle to his entire body. He does have a long stride stride that he can improve on. Competes well in all three zones. Has great vision and a real nice set of hands and is dedicated at improvement in every phase. There will be no transition when the club that drafts him calls him up;he already understands what is necessary , has a professional air about him in that he already is detail oriented and serious about succeeding as a player. He is a high character individual whose star is beginning to shine brighter as the year goes on. One of the safest picks on the board."
0,2019,Mike Koster,"His high school years started with him battling injuries, but the the healthy version is a compact defenseman who can play many different styles. can carry the biscuit, make nice tape to tape breakouts, and will show you a bit of snarl and physicality if it is necessary. Doesn't back down on the ice, and we feel he will not rest off either and will find his way into the high levels of the game. Committed to the University of Minnesota.\"
0,2019,Braden Doyle,Committed to Boston University.
0,2019,Maxence Guenette,"A wide framed defender with soft hands for receiving and sending pucks forward. At this juncture, he is more of a complimentary offensive player, but has a strong recognition to paying the defensive part of his position. Defending on the rush he is able to m mirror the attackers movements when they go one on one. Square up well, lets the attacks try a move and then closes down. He gets his stick on inches end to cut off the East-West pass. Under pressure he can play fast to elude the opposition with his quick stick to get it out in transition. Has a wide body and will fill in. A long term developmental."
0,2019,Jackson Millar,Committed to Colorado College.
0,2019,Jeremi Gerber,"Strong skating Swiss winger with a powerful smooth stride. Very good strength and skill.  Plays a determined game with physicality and with offensive smarts on the attack. Good in the corners and battle zones. He gets open in the seams on offensive. Doesn't let up in transition to get back and help out in his end. Passes and supports on attack. Is fearless in going to the net, unearthing pucks and engaging the opposition with plenty of grit."
0,2019,Drew Helleson,"Tall USA National Development defenseman with excellent mobility, playmaking prowess, passing ability, and calmness to his game.Moves the biscuit well and will activate from his defensive position. Capable as a power play quarterback and smart and able to get penalty kill time. Very responsible at reading the developing attack and as adept at being part of the attack. Needs a bit more time to get stronger and develop fully. Committed to Boston College."
0,2019,Danny Weight,"Doug's son has good size, vision, hands and a quick release to his shot. A hard working player with a straightforward style of creating offensive chances. His skating stride is going to have to improve radically for his name to be called. Committed to Boston College."
0,2019,Kyle Topping,"Under six foot centre with a smooth skating stride and glide, and good lower body strength that lets him reach a higher gear in races to loose pucks. Has a good feel for the attack zone and take sup occupancy in different areas between to the dots, looking for second and third chances off shots. His stick is positioned close to the ice in the high traffic areas and battle zone areas. Relentless and instinctual on the attack."
0,2019,Lucas Feuk,A Swedish centre who plays a smart game as a playmaker and plays well on the power play. Has some grit to his game and will go into the corners looking but not a true banger. Reads the ice and developing plays and is quickly there as an outlet for his defenseman when they need one. Good vision offensive but still has parts to fit in place.
0,2019,Will Francis,"Big bodied defender who has worked himself into the top defensive role for the RoughRiders. Plays with great strength and grittiness, but there are signs of offensive upside as he has nice puck skills too. He plays smart and physical in his end, and seems to have quickly adjust to the high pace level of the USHL. Confident and can move the puck out of his end in transition and isn’t afraid to provide support by jumping into the rush. There simply isnt not a decent level of quick stop/start ability at . this juncture. What he still lacks is a quick first step, and needs to add overall mobility. This gets him in trouble in the tight spaces. Intriguing developmental player whose rising up the draft boards"
0,2019,Yegor Chizhikov,Russian winger with a long stick who is a master at stickhandling the puck.. A creative passer who with excellent feet and stride that enables him to carry checkers along for the ride. Very good staright ahead speed to turn the outside corner to drive to the front of the net. Handles tough passes and goes tom the front. There is very little not to like about this youngster.
0,2019,Owen Lindmark,"A strong on his skates, two way centre with a strong commitment to a two way game. Good on face-offs. Not flashy, just a hard working meat N potatoes forward. Committed to the University of Wisconsin."
0,2019,Kalle Loponen,"Undersized defender who plays with the jam of a bigger man due to his core strength.  Good skater with good hands who is skilled in both receiving pucks and passing them on at full speed.can spin away from forechecking pressure and use his strong wrists to quickly get the biscuit up ie in transition. Can make thread the needle to the long pass out. Know when to pinch on the attack, and will join rushes. Will walk the blue and get the puck to his forwards. Can place pucks over shot blockers and has a hard pass. Long term developmental guy."
0,2019,Ludvig Hedström,"A smart defender with excellent hockey sense and a good stick. Displays soft hands that can given receive passes on the fly. Competes hard and stays with his man in one to one coverages.  Confident in what he can do with the puck, but is more of a stay at home complimentary push player."

0,2019,Kirby Proctor,Committed to the University of Nebraska at Omaha.
0,2019,Quinn Olson,"Linemate of Dylan Holloway who plays a sound game without the puck;he gets to the open areas, and reacts quickly to the play. He moves well East to West while carrying at top speed. Has a low center of gravity and plays strong on the wall and corners and wins  puck battles. Committed to the University of Minnesota-Duluth."
0,2019,Parker Ford,Undersized centreman is constantly moving no matter which zone he is in. A good passer who has a fast stick. Looked like one of the fastest player in the World junior Challenge. Darts to open ice and causes problems for the defenders on the rush. Unearths loose pucks and squeezes past coverage on the wall. Will deke through layers of defenders. Works hard and was reward in the World Junior A Challenge with two goals and two assists. Committed to Providence College.
0,2019,Lucas Johansson,A huge second year eligible goaltender who displays a strong base and a trust in his ability to use his mechanics and prevent goals.  Wastes no energy and and stays cool and calm under fire. is able to absorb and hold shots when attackers are at the doorstep. Is athletic and uses his long legs to prevent backdoor scores and is agile enough to throw the pads out and direct pucks to his teammates while sliding in the opposite direction.
0,2019,Oliver Okuliar,"Lanky Slovakian wing with skill and feistiness. He ran up strong numbers in Slovakian Junior. Not a quick-footed attacker, but can drive the play. Has shown well at the lower levels. Good stick-handling and playmaking abilities that, with development, might help him find his way to the pro game. Hard to play against. Strong on his pins and in puck battles."
0,2019,Samuel Sjölund,"Developing defender with good offensive tools and recognition skills. Competes hard and initiates contact, and steps up to meet attackers at his blue line. Steps in to get loose pucks on face-offs. Maintains his coverage while clogging passing lanes, and boxes out opposing players in the crease area. Makers good decision and plays well from his blue down in. Had good hands."
0,2019,Mitchell Brewer,"A play it safe defender with a calm demeanor and solid defensive end game. Isn’t going to get your attention with rink long carries or flashy activations into the attack zone; he does, however use huis body to shield pucks he is carrying. He is an excellent shot blocker, takes away the cross-ice feed, and gets between the puck carrier and his outlet. Strong checker who can remove attackers form the puck and always takes the body when he is faced with one on one. Displays good jump, smooth footwork, and good recognition that suggest he may with time, develop into an excellent stay at home defenseman."
0,2019,Alexander Campbell,Undersized forward who has elite feet. A true blazer whjo explodes out of his starts and will jet out of traffic to open ice with the puck. His soft hands enable him to receive and pass pucks while in top gear. Dipslays excellent vison on the attack and will freeze goalies by cahngingbhis stickhandling tempo so they think that signals shot coming sooner than it does.. Committed to Clarkson University.
0,2019,Alex Young,Committed to Colgate University.
0,2019,Ethan Haider,Committed to Clarkson University.
0,2019,Ronnie Attard,"3rd year eligible defender who moves the puck and passes well. Displays good mobility, and a strong shot, and shot blocking fortitude. Was a big minute eater who was asked to be a responsible shutdown defenseman. On occasion, he punishes the opposition with his hard-nosed physical play. Committed to Western Michigan."
0,2019,Juuso Pärssinen,"A Centre-forward with nice size and girth and power to his stride. Strong face-off man who can use his big frame to set up below the face off circles. Has very good hands and touch. Uses his frame to keep attackers away and to gain position. He needs to use his size with more grit along the boards, and needs to add to his initial skating burst if he wants to continue his upward spiral. Scored four times in the Five Nations U-18."
0,2019,Grant Silianoff,"Winger who Is an excellent skater with terrific footwork. His feet enable him be excellent on the penalty kill, using his high end stop/starts to be an aggressive presence on the kill. Good on zone entires; he staggers them using the repertoire his hands and feet allow him. Can cut from edge to edge and he is difficult for a defender to diagnose constantly in motion and varying his routes. Gets such a strong push that he exposes defenders who lay back and effortless slashes his way through the seams to open area. Committed to Notre Dame University."
113,2018,Aidan Dudas,"This high energy diminutive centre can play, compete in the battle areas with a lateral quickness that is difficult to contain. An elusive carrier and fearless forechecker who takes the hit to make the play. Many times eludes what looks like certain contact with his quickness and agility."
0,2019,Ivan Muranov,"Big Russian wing with an excellent size/skill package. Good wheels and some jam. Put up good numbers in the MHL, but again his selection is based on when he can or will make the jump to North America."
0,2019,Zachary Uens,Committed to Merrimack College.
110,2018,Xavier Bernard,"Tall left side defender who plays a bit bigger than he is. Is solid in his own end and is very good in all phases of the defensive zone. Passes the puck well and has good hands under pressure. He plays with some edge and tries to let the opposition know he is out there. Untapped offensive potential due to his hockey IQ, hands, and stick. Scored 11 goals and 35 points in the open QMJHL, so that leads me to think there is upside as an attacker too. Big solid junior defender who projects as a guy a team takes and develops. Displays good play-making ability and balance. His skating is a work in progress. He is good straight ahead, but you want more agility and better pivots in setting his gaps. As he hones his play at both ends of the ice, you would like to see a bit more physicality."
112,2018,Jack St. Ivany,Committed to Yale University.
108,2018,Demetrios Koumontzis,"High skilled centre with high end ability to play a heavier game, win pucks, and position himself to an advantage in the heavy puck battling areas. Had very good vision, and displays a very good array of skills. Is good on the cycle and in as a scorer. He lead the Minnesota Elite League this fall with 16 goals, 49 points in 21 games. Committed to Arizona State University."
0,2019,Michael Vukojevic,"Athletic defenseman who trying to put the pieces, confidnece, and tempo together to develop into a true NHL prospect. At times he looks like one, but others he looks hesitant and not completely relaxed enough to just play his game. He has quite a few gifts that qualify him as a developmental payer a team is going to take and try and grow his game. Has a strong backward skating motion, and fast stick that can break things top and a strong low shot. Wins puck battles, and offensively can feather the puck up to his teammates looking for deflections. Has offensive jam and will venture down low. His neutral zone work is anxious. Committed to University of Michigan."
106,2018,Curtis Douglas,"Six eight and still growing, this left winger has massive frame and uses it for body lean and not as a destructive hitter. Long reach gets him to loose pucks and he protects the puck very well. Has good hands in close. A work in progress who is just learning the nuances of playing in his own end and coverage. Long term developmental prospect."
109,2018,Tyler Weiss,"Long term developmental cente-wing with a solid skill set. Has nice hands and very good feet, playmaking ability and a high compete level. The issue is that he needs time to get bigger. Should add to his frame so he can be able to handle physicality and win puck battles in the battle zones and on the wall.  Committed to Boston University."
105,2018,Martin Pospisil,Big Slovakian wing who will get time to develop at St. Lawrence University.
104,2018,Lenni Killinen,"A Finnish work in progress that already has size, some girth, and some puck skills. Excellent balanced skater with blow by you acceleration and straight line speed. Difficult to impeded as he has a strong balanced stride that can barrel him through the neutral zone. An above average stickhandler who has a nice shot and can thread the needle passes on the move. He needs to make better attack zone decision with his carries and passes. Longer term project with upside who has to become more aware. Reads the on ice situations and play with more effort away from the puck, and ready when it’s time to dial it up a notch."
103,2018,Jacob Pivonka,"Son of former NHL player Michal Pivonka, he is a bottom six two way centre. Committed to the University of Notre Dame."
101,2018,Nico Gross,"Solid defender who has some two way ability. Has concentrated on the defensive end in the OHL. Looked good on the Swiss U-20 team in the World Juniors, but don't expect much up ice push."
99,2018,Stanislav Demin,"A solid defensive defenseman who's offensive side is starting to blossom. Strong skater with a wide base and good pivots that allows him to take an aggressive line of defense. He closes the gap to contact. Very instinctive, smart in his reads and understanding of his position. Has an active stick always disrupting the passing lanes. Positions himself so he always seems to have leverage on the competition to take them off the biscuit. Transitions out of his end well, and also passes the puck out well. He can carry out in transition and enter the attack zone due to his wide skating base. A work in progress, but lots of good things there including one of the better skating strides backwards. Committed to Denver University."
111,2018,Jáchym Kondelik,Massive Czech giant who may project to the wing. Long reach and stick that provides a big area of coverage. Has a good bit of skill. Long term developmental prospect who needs to get his movement caught up with his size. Should continue to build  more of an offensive game. Also needs to learn to better handle possession in smaller areas.
95,2018,Johnny Gruden,High energy wing who has some upside offensively. Never takes a shift off shows a bit of elusiveness. Has an ability to ramp up a gear when attacking. Sees his options and advances the puck well. His speed makes him tough to cover in the hard areas. Committed to the University of Miami (Ohio)
98,2018,Ryan O'Reilly,"Long term project with significant skills, size and girth, but needs more playing time to see larger roles and situations. Has a big time shot and a willingness to use his size. Committed to the University of Denver, but that is probably not until the 2019-20 school year."
94,2018,Matej Pekar,"The USHL top rookie scorer may not be a high end speedster. He does have creativity, high end vision, a good motor, and contributes in many areas. Has a good change of direction and offensive prowess. Keeps his head on a swivel. Comes out of corners creating scoring chances with good passes and lets loose his rocket shot. Still a work in progress who needs to get better all around and stronger."
38,2016,Adam Mascherin,"A sleeper drafted two season back by Florida. Decided to let him re-enter the draft since other NHL clubs didn't offer the second round pick they invested in his selection. He can thread a soft pass or score with his accurate heavy wrist shot. A short, thick centremen who bowls his way around the attack zone. Displays good skills in the attack zone. Not agile laterally or a blazer, he is an excellent North-South skater with speed and will push through defenders if he can find a path around. Strong on the puck in his carries. Displays excellent vision to make plays with his soft passes or his quick trigger. Needs to work on understanding defensive zone positioning. A work in progress that may not be tall but certainly is a tank."
97,2018,Allan McShane,"The bar was set high when he arrived in the OHL because of the high skill levels he brought to the table. He is a 200 foot player with hockey smarts and the ability to make precise passes offensively. Good in the dot and uses his speed in the middle zone, but stalls when he gets in high traffic areas. The team that selects him will encourage a bit more tenacity in his one-on-one puck battles. He might project as a left wing."
91,2018,Nathan Smith,Playmaking centre who can play with anyone on his flanks. Committed to Minnesota State University at Mankato.
96,2018,Luke Henman,"Skinny six foot centre good hands patience,  and good hockey IQ. Moves well both East-West and North-South, and raeds the situations on ice well. Long term prospect who must get physically stronger allowing him to get better on his skates, and allow him to compete."
88,2018,Joey Keane,2nd year eligible who has been a solid PP defender with a defense-first game but room for growth.
86,2018,Alexander Khovanov,"Flying a bit under the radar because the Q import was sidelined with Hepatitis C until almost January. Played slow and looked out of place during increased playoff pace. That might hurt his chances of wooing a team's scouting staff into taking him early. Takes needless penalties and didn't show much commitment, coming in out of shape. Initially looked like he might be a first rounder."
89,2018,Logan Hutsko,Second year eligible centre who has a strong all-around game. Committed to Boston College.
85,2018,Lukas Dostal,"A well-balanced, well-controlled goalie with a cool and calm demeanor. Has a good glove hand, moves with balance side-to-side and up-and-down. Stares down shooters so they make the first move. Is under control and angles shots off into the corners. Reduces rebounds in the middle area. Never riled and focuses when barraged with traffic in the home plate area. Finds loose pucks before opponents do. All-in-all a good long term developmental player who needs to get a bit taller and add plenty of muscle and girth."
83,2018,Riley Stotts,"From mites to junior, he has been one of the more heralded players as he has excelled at each level. An elite skater with a strong burst who brings it every shift. Can dominate as an attacker with his very natural quick release. Finds the open creases on the attack. Will blow in, slide stop, and then have the space to surprise with a laser.  Fires right on net with screens and his speed is problematic when he cuts in -- freezing defenders. Did I mention he's good in the corners? Gives a solid defensive effort, and sneakily grabs and leans to impede the movement of the enemy. Looked really good in the CHL Prospects game."
82,2018,Bulat Shafigullin,"Has a total of 17 KHL games under his belt and saw mostly action in the MHL and the VHL. A sleeper who hasn't been in international tournaments or even played Russian youth hockey. Already displays a strong balanced skating stride, good agility, and the ability to generate chances and score."
79,2018,Blake McLaughlin,"Quick and elusive puckhandler and scoring centre-forward. Very good hockey sense, excellent hands, and finish. He is among the top scorers in the USHL. At this point he is very one dimensional.  He does see some PK time but needs to build strength and an over-all 200 foot game. Needs time to add lower body strength to aid his skating. Committed to the University of Minnesota."
75,2018,Oscar Bäck,"Big Swedish forward with a good two-way game, face-off ability. Good vision, handles the biscuit well and can create offense. Needs to improve balance, bursts, and skating agility, and also start using his size as an advantage. Not a high end creator as he lacks first step quickness, and lateral agility. But, he can always pull it off."
92,2018,Connor Dewar,Physical competitive undersized centre-wing who teams hate to play against. Low center of gravity and an ability to hit the back of the net.
77,2018,Jakub Lauko,"Talented centre-winger who is a bit farther away from turning pro, but who displays keen offensive skills. Has superb feet and lateral agility to dart and turn defenders inside out in the attack zone. Displays solid vision and creative play-making, coupled with end to end speed. Didn’t see much playing time in World Junior U-20 but shined at the Five Nations under 18. Has really nice hands and a quick release on his snap shot. Needs to get much stronger, bulk up, and needs to be a 60 minute dominant attacker. So far, his dynamic offense shows, but seems to fade and disappear. He sometimes plays so fast that his take-ways leave his line mates in the dust behind the play. Learning to use his speed, create space, and let plays percolate are what need developing, along with upper body strength.  Not ready to absorb the physicality of the pro game, I would call him a work in progress who has to get better defensively and continue to grow his hockey awareness."
74,2018,Niklas Nordgren,"Finnish full speed attacker and set up man who is under 5’ 10 and 170. Plays hard and fast with good smarts for seeing openings and capitalizing. Scored eight goals in the Under-18 World Junior Tournament, more than any other player. Displays really good hands and has the toolbox of a scorer. Has good on-ice vision and drives to the right areas to win pucks. Surprises the opposition with set ups and goals they they are unprepared for. Needs to continue to improve his feet, strength and his size."
78,2018,Sampo Ranta,"Perimeter attacker with good size, hands, shot, and skating ability. Wastes energy as a one man act instead of using his teammates to attack and get good looks. Lacks understanding well enough to find open seams and lacks creativity as an attacker. Committed to the University of Wisconsin, where he may invest in acquiring an all-around game."
72,2018,Jakub Skarek,"Big tall goaler able to make athletic saves and absorb shots to his pads. Very flexible and active around the crease. Has the come ""up-eens"" to get behind the net to break up around-the-horn rim-arounds. Really good down low and has rebound control. Still developing and seems to lose focus after letting in a stinker or two. That will affect his entire team's emotion. At times, was the best goalie in the 2016 Ivan Hlinka Tournament and at others - was suspect. Still lots to like when you project the longer path goalies to hone their games."
81,2018,Seth Barton,"Not going to be your attacking offenseman, but shows the potential to be a big strong shutdown defenseman. Committed to the UMass-Lowell."
71,2018,Jordan Harris ,"Another new age smaller defender with quick head, feet, and puck-handling ability. Quick and decisive with the biscuit. His deft stick-handling and puck management get him high marks despite playing against competition. Committed to Northeastern University."
68,2018,Tyler Madden,"Son of John Madden, he is an undersized checking line wing with good feet and 200 foot commitment. Very hard forechecker who makes chances from the turnovers he causes. Has speed that aids him on the penalty kill too. Creates space and time with solid decisions. Must get more weight and strength because he gets overpowered off the puck at times."
69,2018,Jake Wise,"Under the radar performer who is a terrific skater with strong skill set. His year was marred by various nagging injuries. An average skater who is a good two-way player whether lined up at centre or either wing. He is smart on the ice, good in the dot, supports the puck, shows creativity in the attack. Committed to Boston University where he will hone his skills hopefully ascending to a strong third line NHL centre."
64,2018,Justus Annunen,"Big framed goaler with patience, good reads, and positioning. Moves well side to side with solid footwork, staying square to oncoming shooters. Doesn't give the opposition much to shoot at. He stays big and then can use his size and legs to take away all the lower part of the net. Needs work on his rebound control and tracking the puck better. At this point is not the greatest athletic goalie. Improving his reaction time would help, and his puck-handling. Has patience and the team that drafts him will need some too."
66,2018,Cameron Hillis,"Undersized centre with skill and decent instincts in the attack zone. Long term project who needs more strength. Not very productive in the dot for a centre. He often gets taken off the puck. He seems to bolt up ice in anticipation to his team taking possession. That means he leaves his check and many times, the pass doesn't come to pass. Needs to improve to a better 200 foot game."
67,2018,Alec Regula ,"Lanky defenseman with four direction skating ability, size, strength, and effective defensive zone prowess.  Maintains solid gaps, keeps his check funneled outside the middle, and is good in front at impeding attackers progress. Makes the first pass out, shows some creativity and smarts when he does venture in on the attack. The offensive end will surely come as he develops more confidence in what he can do."
73,2018,Ty Emberson,"Playing behind bigger names in the USNTDP d-core,  Emberson plays a simple yet effective game. His positioning 1-on-1 allows him to be very capable shutting down offense, while also allowing him the opportunity to deliver thunderous open ice hits. He does not shy away from physical play or from engaging attackers."
63,2018,Jack McBain,A big-bodied strong player who competes hard game in and game out. Relentless despite having a strong ensemble of players to provide supplementary scoring. Establishes his position using his stature and competitiveness to wins battles and space in the scoring areas. Has soft hands and scoring ability. At times his feet look really heavy and he doesn’t keep them moving. Has the strength to carry defenders with him. Is very difficult  to move him from the crease area on the power play. The skating issues may really hurt his chances because he lacks balance. Takes short strides to his skating and isn’t an accomplished skater to work these issues out in a year with an instructor. Committed to Boston College.
65,2018,Jan Jenik,"Raw, skinny, big framed Czech wing with good vision, hand-eye co-ordination, and soft fast hands. Has a long reach and plays strong on the puck. Is quick with reacting and processing. Displays plenty of dangle with his stick-handling ability and agility. Reaches loose pucks, is quick to send the puck on to a teammate. Has good vision and some creativity as a generator along with a quick release in small areas. Needs to fill in the frame and continue his upward developmental climb."
59,2018,Gabriel Fortier,"Undersized centre-forward who plays fast and all 200 feet. Good recognition in the attack zone, and has quick-strike capability as a scorer. Plays on the penalty kill, is strong on his skates, and has good touch with the biscuit."
62,2018,Olivier Rodrigue ,"Still growing and filling out, the young Q goaltender is very calm and collected in his net. Positionally strong and displays solid rebound control. Quick both side-to-side and up-down as the play is about to come to him. Doesn't let traffic affect his challenging the shot. Keeps his team in games and projects as the top goalie candidate in this class in my opinion."
58,2018,Filip Hållander,"Lean, very agile winger with excellent edging, speed, and acceleration. Might develop into a real scoring threat because he is attacks with East-West mobility and fearless net front presence. Still maturing both physically and as an all around player. He uses his get-up to capitalize on pinching defenseman and in shorthanded situations. Still a work in progress who needs better recognition and muscle to help out in his defensive zone. Looks like there is potential here which will help see his name called fairly early."
61,2018,Ivan D Morozov,Offensively skilled centre who stood out at the World Junior Challenge as an unselfish pass-first centremen who works very hard to play a 200 foot ice.  A larger framed guy with a long smooth  powerful stride. A pair of soft hands and playmaking ability. Not a finished product but you have to project that there is lots to like. The scoring and offensive generating will only get better as he builds a more mature offensive game.
0,2019,Nick Bochen,Committed to the University of Michigan.
0,2019,Danila Galenyuk,"Big strong dependable Russian defender who gets overlooked by virtue of his ability to play a mistake free game without being a standout dynamic player at his position. Uses his size, never gets panicked and stays on the right side of the ouck most of the time. No flash and dash, but is very effective and solid in his end, and able to move the puck up ice and nevr cabve to forechecking pressure. Works the wall physically."
60,2018,David Gustafsson,"No one who views him will see future star centremen or offensive scorer. That being said, they will see one of the most advanced defensive centres in the class. Good balance and feet. Not a guy with a full pallet of acceleration gears. Nor will he set up defenders to reach to him and then see him fly by. He does have a nice stride that keeps him next to his man in coverage and able to win pucks away. Effective on the penalty kill in the Five Nations tournament. So far shows decent hands and a good sense in the attack zone. But, he has displayed a strong offensive repertoire and the same intensity one on one when on the attack. Good long term potential because he thinks the game well, and plays to win."
0,2019,Kosta Manikis,"Rugged rangy skating centre-wing who plays with power on the attack. Bears down quickly when in forechecking, and good enough . on his pins to make sure he is active in the other two zones. Will drive hard on the attack and might be able to weave through opponents in three zones to set up looks. Fundamenatly solid game with the cahnce to advance."
0,2019,Nathan Dunkley,Under six foot centre who plays bigger than that with a strong compete level. Always willing to jump in to the thick of things to create turnovers with lots of hard wall work. Hard forechecker and physical disrupter. Has soft hands and passes the puck efficiently. Aggressive in the attack zone with his quick feet and good anticipation in the seams. Not going to  score a ton but will get noticed each and every shift.
0,2019,Aaron Huglen,Raw forward prospect who plays hard and attacks with power. Very effective down low and domin ates at the high school level. Has a quick release and has good vision to read the offensive set-up and set up scoring chances.  Committed to the University of Minnesota where he will get stronger.
0,2019,Brett Budgell,"Wing with a solid compete level, battling hard one scrum after another, and gets bigger players off the puck with body leverage. A smart player who finds the creases to be open for outlet passes. Moves to the front rapidly always looking to throw off the goalies. Will get bigger and gain leg strength. And that will enrich the physical aspects he already applies."
0,2019,Christopher Meriser Ortiz,Undersized defender who is very agile in all directions of motion. A reliable paaser surveys his options and has the ability to feather pucks over sticks. He keeps tight gaps and sticks with his man in the back pedal.  Long term potential.
0,2019,Sasha Mutala,"Physical player who dominate the U-17 who can cut and stop / start on a dime. Not the most skilled or big forward but simply is the best one by way of his sixty minute relentless effort. Strong enough to deliver one hand passes. Will fire while on the move, and has good hand-eye and redirects many pucks. Strong poke-checker and can bring the puck out of his end. He creates disruptions with his heavy forecheck. Excels in the high traffic areas whether he has the puck or not. High hockey IQ and a nose for the net, he needs to improve his defensive zone recognition, but he is an intense work boots on guy who wants to eventually win Lord Stanley’s cup."
0,2019,Oliver Turan,"Big man with a big frame massive reach and interesting skill set. Has surprising balance with a nice knee bend that lowers him and allows him to move adeptly on his skates. Is a good passer who reads the ice and passes the puck well. He uses his wingspan to move attackers toward the outside wall, but can in his back pedal, backward cross-over to adjust to the faster forwards. Good at using his stick to lift the opponents, and can quickly get passes up-ice. Handles the puck well in tight, and has a good feel for the offensive zone, willing to step down for rebounds and set-ups. lots to like."
0,2019,Kevin Wall,"Second year eligible centre-forward whonis very able to set the offensive plays with good passes to the right players / areas. Has skill, skating abilty and size. A Buffalo-area native, he is committed to Penn State University."
0,2019,Evgeni Oksentyuk,Tiny Belarusian winger (Cole Caufield size) can make his own draft history by a good turnout at the Under-18 world championships going on right now. Scores in a variety of ways and is a hockey play despite the knocks on his size.
0,2019,Nikita Alexandrov,Under six foot thick winger who has offensive skills and good speed. Some perceive him as more of a scorer based on his shot and offensive gifts but also creativity and excellent unselfish passing skills. Plays with intensity when on the offense but also needs to play stronger without the puck and in his own end.
0,2019,Justin Ducharme,High speed player who blossomed late. Displays a powerful stride and the speed to beat wingers from the outside. Super quick starts . ands gets on the defenders on the forecheck quicker than they would like. Has a hard wrist shot. his feet are an asset on the penalty kill. I would like to see him more involved in the greasy areas.Can add weight and muscle to his frame.
0,2019,Massimo Rizzo,Skill winger who has good East-West skating agility who beats defenders off the rush. Small but all compact with agility in his East-West movements. A skilled stickhandler who can hang onto the biscuit at top speed.
0,2019,Ethan Phillips,Diminutive prospect with high. End offensive instincts. Won team West MVP in the USHL Prospects game. After arriving he. Has. A 43 point / 50 game season. Committed to Boston University.
0,2019,Dustin Wolf,"Small goalie with agility, who competes hard. Plays like a warrior at his position."
0,2019,Eric Uba,Ultra-competitive take no prisoners winger who has had a solid campaign. You won't notice high end offensive skills or blistering speed-jus a player who fights a 200 foot war in the puck battles. His expertise wall and corners are where his value comes from. Scores most of his goals from in close fearless of contact and thrives on contact. He is very defensively responsible. His value exudes when you take into consideration he is usually the forward down low in the dee zone even though he is one of the wingers. The kid is a player every team needs to win.
0,2019,Luka Burzan,"Quick skating wing with quick hands, who hasn't reached his highest levels of proficiency. Still looking to perfect a solid all-around game especially since he is surrounded by quality players in Moose Jaw. A good technician who reads the ice very well. Is an above average forechecker who steals pucks along the wall and in crowded areas. Quickly finds open teammates and gets open as a safety valve for his teammates. Is steady in his carries, drawing defenders and then advances the puck to his open teammate. Rapidly jumps up into the slot looking for loose rebounds. Is good on his edges to keep transporting himself to different open seams. The offensive side just hasn't come scoring only 15 goals all season. He did score five times for Brandon in 11 playoff games. Once thought of as a top prospect when he arrived, he is now considered a  developmental guy someone will take a chance on."
0,2019,Samuel Hlavaj,Huge Slovak goaltender with terrific athleticism who kept his team in games against the highly stacked teams they played against.
0,2019,Joe Carroll,"Off handed left wing with excellent size and above average skating ability. Was expected to lead his team but his lack of vision and other shortcomings have dropped him down their depth charts, as he was expected to use his size to win pucks and play with more resolve. He is now thought of as along term developmental player. Nine goals and 31 points isn’t cutting it."
0,2019,Christopher Giroday,Committed to Western Michigan University.
0,2019,Hugo Alnefelt,"Swedish net minder with nice size, glove and blacker. Tracks shots well and uses his pads to direct those pucks to his defenseman. Even uses his skates to kick them past those attackers lurking near the blue paint. Absorbs shots with his frame, and reacts well on rebound attempts. Still developing his reads and improving his play."
0,2019,William Constantinou,"Traded from a loaded Niagara club where he was a top four defender to a rebuilding Kingston club where he is getting top two minutes and duties. His fine mobile skater who footwork can keep up with any quick wingers on the outside. He has a accurate shot to the net, but sometimes make things difficult with his handles and turns them over. Displays clean edging and moves laterally to evade checkers. Questionable hockey sense and understanding of his responsibilities in defense zone coverage. This is a long term developmental guy who looks like a solid offensively skilled defender who is still lacking in many areas as a defender. You catch glimpses of one side of the game but they balance out with the times you see what is lacking."
0,2019,Michal Mrazik,Big framed Slovakian winger with choppy starting steps but a keen sense for the open areas of the offensive zone. Hangs around behind and the front of the net looking to score loose pucks. Plays with shorter stick and it allows him excellent control. This big guy leans on the oponents all over the ice. Needs work on improving his stride.
0,2019,Liam Ross,Well-rounded OHL defender with good size whose just putting his game together so it becomes part of the conversation as developing defenseman. He is a very good skater with excellent vision and good pivots in transition. Displays good gap control and effective coverage in both the neutral and defensive zones. Plays with his head up and uses good body position in his end and make strong passes out in transition. Has played conservative and has been reluctant to attempt creative offensive plays but has started venturing down from the point  into the open creases in coverage. Needs time to continue developing.
0,2019,Reece Newkirk,"Undersided forward capable of playing with the big boys. Smart passer with improving puck handling skill, he battles for all contested ice and crashes his way to the blue paint. He is not afraid of anyone. Had 59 points in 68 ames."
0,2019,Michael Gildon,Winger who displays quick hands and the ability to shoot in tight areas. Has good speed and mobility and is an effective up and down wing who is an good passer who can create scoring chances. Committed to Ohio State University.
0,2019,Matias Maccelli,Slight under six foot winger who passes the puck extremely well and displays overall quickness.
0,2019,Arseni Gritsyuk,"Elusive and tight edged little left winger with speed and top end stick handling savvy while at top gear. Slippery with tight spins and quick stop/starts. Doesn’t allow defenders to corral him, and persists after absorbing big hit. Out-hustles defenders to loose pucks in the offensive zone, and will come into to a scrum as the odd man and stays on the periphery to steal the biscuit as it tickles out. Dangerous off the rush and can beat defenders one on one. Displays a short stick handle in tight space and will stutter step the goalie before taking the shot. His quick stop/starts while carrying the puck help him create separation. Gets a ton of chances for his line and himself with his high energy and effort."
0,2019,Valentin Nussbaumer,"Top Swiss player makes the transition to the QMJHL and that will be a good measuring stick of his all around skill and competitiveness. Supports the play on all three zones with a strong stick and crafty moves in the attack zone. Transitions out of his end come to him and he quickly gains entrance into the attack zone and is elusive enough to engage more than one defender as he darts in and out of small areas, allowing his teammates join the attack.	 After the success of Swiss centre Nico Hischier a high bar of expectation was set with Nussbaumer’s ensuing entrance into North American hockey and the Quebec Major junior league which seems a perfect fit for him, as he saw time in the top Swiss league last season and it seemed like his shiftiness, great instincts, a deft touch and vision would transfer effortless to the Q. But his 17 goal, 38 point year with Shawingan can only be described as a disappointment. I do think an NHL teams will invest in by the fourth round and wait for him to figure it out."
0,2019,Trevor Janicke,"USA National Development grad. Who is a solid centre and skilled scorer, with feet and edging that let him navigate the tight spaces and get looks. Has confidence he can take pucks away from opponents on the wall, and plays with enough jump tp them to pucks in their end. Needs to improve his skating stride and that will make him even more of a threat as a forechecker in the same way he has continued to add physical strength to hold his position, and play strong. Good passer who gets the biscuit to his teammates in prime scoring areas. Is more of a cross over. Attacker who will gain momentum in his East-West movements to find an opening. Has a good shot that he can let off quick and compactly. A longer developmental guy who is putting it together. Committed to the University of Notre Dame."
0,2019,Graeme Clarke,"Lean winger with an exceptional first step, excellent balance, and acceleration and nice puck skills. Swoops in and steals pucks and starts back the other way. He retrieves then settle the puck down, and gets nice looks with his shot. Hard worker down low with good pressure when his team isn’t holding it. A good shooter who usually shoots far side to cause rebounds to his line mates, and can also toe drag shoot off the rush. His strength is that when he explodes North-South he can use his agility to shift weight and feet and he’s cut through laterally. Needs time, but speed kills."
0,2019,Cole Mackay,"Smart smaller compact winger who understands what it takes to win and does it, every shift. Due to the fact he got to play nest to Morgan Frost, he was a afforded the time to advance his game while without the puck, creating space, racing coverage and finding the soft spots. Relentless in puck pursuit as he goes fast and hard into the corners does so many things that help his team win. Kills penalties and is determined  to continue his upward climb. Finished with 27 goals and 61 points in 65 games He is the a player you can slide up and down your line-up through four lines, but you wish you had one for each of the lines."
0,2019,Josh Nodler,"A pass first playmaking centre whose a tad under six foot and 200 lbs. Displays excellent vision and awareness, and makes plays everywhere on the sheet. Strong skater who can drive through contact, maintaining the possession and placings passes right on teammate’s sticks. Sneaks through the layers of coverage and gets the biscuit to the net. Committed to Michigan State University."
0,2019,Matthew Struthers,This is what I wrote last year in his first year of eligibility: A big raw kid who is a bit of longer term developmental guy in that he hasn't put all the pieces together yet. Has skills but need to be a consistent game to game factor.
0,2019,Vladislav Firstov,"A slippery creative winger with a high skill set and the ability to make offensive play with regularity. Plays key minutes in all phases of the game and makes an impact most shifts. Reads well, and has the willingness and competitiveness to play hard away from the puck, but when he does, look for him to use a quick burst and slice through coverages and generate scoring chances."
0,2019,John Jack Malone,"Big winger with skill and feel for the offensive end in his carries. Although he needs to improve his speed, he skates soundly, with a good stride and some feistiness that enables him to get to the front and finish plays. Plays in traffic and can wear down opponentsHas a good release and a hard shot. Fights to the greasy areas and gets open. Makes nice clean passes and is a strong wall player. Has a bit of elusiveness and short area jump, but will need to develop his leg strength / foot speed. Committed to Cornell University"
0,2019,Luke Toporowski,"His blood traces back to an absolute hard rock beast of a fist fighter in his father, Kerry, and he is undersized physical centre position who also plays a hard heavy style. A smart aggressive and disruptive forechecker who maintains balance and stays with the puck. Creates turnovers because of his style and his questionable stick work, as he is one nasty piece of winner. Keeps his stick on the ice in the scoring areas, and attacks the crease fearlessly hard. Keeps ticking after he has taken a licking too. Will pivot and explode with the. Puck towards the net in one motion. Makes good breakout of his end with crisp passes and plenty of mustard. Think of your favorite smaller NHL pot-stirrer…and feel comfortable with the fact you may seeing this kid in the future."
0,2019,Cameron Rowe,The “other” USA National Development goalie who has a really good glove and tracks pucks exceptionally well. Goaltenders are selected specially to be longer developmental projects and he comes with many tools already in place. And will give time to bring the others along. Committed to the University of North Dakota.
55,2018,Kevin Bahl,"Huge raw defenseman with underrated puck handling and distribution skill, he plays a physical game and gets his long stick into lanes useing his reach to defend. Make a good first pass out of his end. Doesn’t readily transition to full free attacker, but has a willingness to carry the biscuit and is a good stickhandler and passer too. Supports the rush well and will get down deep too. Still a work in development, and will need to improve his shot release and accuracy. Scored two goals in the CHL Prospects game. His size and upside clearly points to him getting his name called to begin the work toward the big league."
53,2018,Calen Addison,"Study, tough, undersized defenseman with good feet, balanced skating, a long glide and light edges. Really good polished offensive game that includes good positioning, fast reactions, and good use of his stick to impede pass receptions. Wins the race to open ice pucks. Never hesitates to stand up attackers. Makes the long stretch pass and uses the side boards to chip pucks by the opposition. Is a deceptive tape to tape passer in the attack zone. Will pinch in and then pivot and make space before driving the puck further into on the attack. There is a fearless confidence to him, that smacks of future NHLer, but undersized for his position."
51,2018,Akil Thomas,"Smaller than average centre-forward who plays much bigger than his size.  Displays terrific speed to dart in and out of areas and make it out with the biscuit.  Not afraid of the work in the corners, his low center of gravity makes him difficult to knock off the puck. Has very good hands and can thread the needle in holes to reach his linemates rushing into the seams. A tireless forechecker who gets his shot off without needing much room. Continues to build on his defensive game and he stays close to his man all the way back in his zone before he transitions up on the offense. Still very light and in need of more weight room work, but looks like a solid prospect due to his all-around commitment and game."
52,2018,Sean Durzi,"A third year eliglble defenseman prospect who had a great start. Suffered a high ankle sprain that kept him out 25 games, but still managed 15 goals and 49 points in 40 season games. Has an excellent playoff until the loaded Sault Ste Marie juggernaut beat them 4-3 in the second round. A top penalty killer and power play guy. Has developed into a top end puck mover who has confidence in his decisions. Makes his team's transition game click. Not too shabby understanding his own end either."
0,2019,Case McCarthy,"The USANDTProgram has now reacts such high levels of excellence that each draft year sees more than a squad’s worth of worthy defenders being drafted. This year is no different with this young man who ranks behind as the third best. Has good size, excellence feet and terrific all-around skills and offensive capabilities. Poised with good size and hands. Seemed to out-shine the rest of the highly regarded US defenders in the Five Nations Tourney last August. Committed to Boston University"
56,2018,Jacob Olofsson,"Younger prospect whose played big minutes for Timra in the Allsvenskan. He displays patience when handling the puck and shows some upside as an offensive generator. Strong on the puck, he makes skilled entries and is able to create time and space in the attack zone with soft passes to his linemates. Not a flashy dominant skater. He compensates with strong two-way game and plays solid in all three zones. He drives to the front fearlessly. A leader who elevates the play of the guys around him. Has good balance and hands and wins the one on one battles. Has a hard shot but looks more like a set-up guy. Still in the developmental stage, he doesn’t hurt you no matter what line or situation he is thrust into."
49,2018,Kirill Marchenko ,"Tall lanky Russian winger with good feet, balance, and stride. Nice lateral agility and quick hands in his carries. Sees the ice well, and is good at putting hard passes on his teammates sticks.  A close area battler for possessions, he is a longer term project who needs more work, but shows promise in all areas."
47,2018,Kody Clark,"Son of Maple leaf legend, Wendel. May not have much lateral agility and is a basic physical grind-it-out big-hitting winger with an edge. Moves North-South with a powerful stride with good lean and is very aggressive on the forecheck. Works hard as a guy who plays between the paint. Looks to disrupt and snap rebounds. Possesses a good wrist shot, plays strong on the puck. Works hard, but only has 18 goals and 39 points to show on his resume. A long term developmental player who needs more to his game."
0,2019,John Farinacci,"A big right shot centre who passes the puck quick and effectively, uses his size to protect pucks and wins the battles along the boards. One of the best passers in high school as he puts but touch and zip on them.A really good skater for a large kid; he needs to work on his first step quickness, but once he is moving straight ahead, he is barreling freight coming down the track. Long term developmental project who needs to get first step quicker, and add sixty minute a compete level. Committed to Harvard University."
48,2018,Jonathan Tychonick,"Another of prototypical new age offense men who stands six foot and hasn’t reached 180 pounds. A riverboat-gamble wild colt who plays that high-risk-high-reward style we see potentially filling the draft’s first round. Has tremendous feet, and is very capable of end to end rushes. Can change the game with a goal or a creative feed for one. A good stickhandler and rusher and has that high-end feel on the attack. Even in tight space, can dangle through seven defenders wondering what just happened. Opens his hips and lets go one-timers on the attack. Will stray closer and closer to the scoring areas until he feels he is going to get checked. Sometimes ill-advisedly thinks he needs to be a one man show; doesn’t use his teammates, the ice, and situations to distribute the puck. He can coming up short and has left his position short of the guy supposed to be playing it. Is timid when he has to go into corners to retrieve pucks or feels footsteps. You would like to see more compete in puck battles in all areas of his defensive zone. There have to be concerns about how he progresses as the competition gets stronger, more physical, and quicker to close space around him. Committed to the University of North Dakota."
50,2018,Adam Ginning,"Big physical defender whose skating, footwork, and pivots improved dramatically over the season. As a defender, he initiates contact, making big hits and rubs out attackers with regularity. Plays big minutes against the better opponents and on the penalty kill. His pivots have shown improvements and he gets on the back pedal tightening his gaps. After transition in his own end, he uses his partner for d-to-d pass and clears his zone effectively with solid outlet passes. Really long-armed and has soft hands with passes and receptions as he moves up ice. Effective and creative with cross ice feeds, jumps up driving the play into the attack zone. This big man reads the offensive end as smart as anyone. Arguably, was the best Swedish player in the Five Nations Tourney. There is long term potential in his selection because he is a player who showed tonnes of improvement in his footwork, and over all agility. He is taking steps in his confidence and involvement in the offensive zone. Upside is there to continue improving past being thought of as a big physical defender with a huge wingspan who handles the puck well."
46,2018,Martin Fehérváry,"Slovak defender who has played the last four years in Sweden. A very good skater with lateral agility and a good stride. Good gap control and processing in the defensive end. Can make the home run pass from his end, and has a willingness to carry the puck out of trouble. Basically sticks to the system. A player with small point totals but the upside to elevate his offensive production as he continues to develop. Had only ten total points during the season and playoff; a workhorse earning tons of ice time. He likes the puck on his stick and has an aggressive side. Still far from a finished product who looks to challenge for a pro job in the not too distant future."
43,2018,Ruslan Iskhakov,"Midget forward who was able to amass 107 points in 50 games after transferring to the Slovakia Under 18 league. A high end attacker with great vision, passing skills, and elusiveness. Needs to develop his on-ice vision and his shot."
45,2018,Scott Perunovich,"Third year eligible undersized defender  with excellent vision and creativity. Has vastly improved his work in the defensive end. His value comes as an attacker, PP QB, and a patient precision passer."
42,2018,Jack Drury,"Doesn't standout as anything but an average sized kid with ordinary jump to his steps. Plays consistent and some edge. Is really on ice smart. Have offensive upside, as his 28 game point streak showed. A gritty battle area player who never stops hustling determined to control the outcome. Committed to Harvard University."
44,2018,Albin Eriksson,"Big Swedish winger who plays both sides. Displays a really nice size/skill ratio who has a long reach and stick. Able to secure, hold, and shield pucks down low.  A good skater with good balance and the ability to drive the play. Handles physicality well and has offensive upside. Solid hockey IQ who has good vision and anticipation. Longer term developmental prospect with upside."
36,2018,Jared McIssac,"Another offensive defenseman with 200 foot capability. Plays solid in his own end and continues to improve as he gains strength and adjusts to the faster pace. Doesn’t get intimidated or flustered. Is willing to challenge attackers by stepping into them or funneling them outside. Played solid in the Ivan Hlinka in the summer, and continued to improve his game all season with Halifax. Has grown to almost six-one and is very mobile puck carrier at 190 pounds. Has found a nice balance of get-up-and-go and stay-back-and-defend, in this the year of the “offense man.” But still prone to forcing plays and some real issues with his lack of awareness and processing in high-pace close-quartered defensive zone situations. He is going to have to be more self aware of when pressure is about to close on him. Better vision and having his head up on a swivel before getting blind-sided or stripped."
54,2018,Benoît-Olivier Groulx,The first pick in the 2016 QMJHL draft is a big solid wing whose not afraid to get gritty. Tall and fundamentally solid in all areas. Strong skater with a nice stride. Plays with strength but truly lacks a quick first step. Understands team play and plays well no matter what line he is on -- and can get the job done. Scores mostly from inside the dots and in front. He likes to bull his way there and take the shot. Isn’t a high end attacker or speedster at this juncture. Plays mostly in a defensive role. Longer term developmental guy who teams you hope builds a stronger offensive game to go along with his defensive presence.
40,2018,Ryan McLeod,"Mikey's Brother is about as fast on his skates as big brother. Big centre with great really good skating ability and a separation gear who creates scoring chances with his quick hands. Uses his size to own the face off circle and dominate opposing centres in many phases with his strong compete level. Strong face-off man and is a good stick-handler able to make neat passes, setting up his linemates. Plays on both the power play and the penalty kill. There are serious questions as to whether he can fill a NHL top six role because he simply hasn’t shown very much scoring prowess. He shows defensive capabilities but I would like him to have a lot more edge and push at his size. The NHL can tolerate a “finesse” big centre IF he is a scorer, but no so much if he isn’t."
35,2018,Jesse Ylönen,"Son of Juha, who played five seasons with Phoenix and other NHL teams. A slight six foot winger with really good acceleration, agility, and top gears. Nimble in small space and can pivot to change direction, creating space in the process. Sees the ice well, and usually knows which option to hit with the puck. A work in progress. He needs to get much bigger/stronger. In doing so, he'll be less likely to get knocked off the puck, play with more jam, and have better judgement in his decisions under pressure."
41,2018,Bode Wilde,"He is over 6 foot 2 and the first thing you notice is how fast he transports himself and the puck around the sheet.  He is a good passer but you can’t help but notice he wants to hold on to the puck, come into the attack zone, and be the difference maker. He stands out on the power play or whenever his team is in attack mode. Gets a lot of power behind his heavy shot. Easily slips down to soft areas, receive pucks, and take shots between the dots -- and he loves to do it. Uses his skating ability as an asset when being a defender. Harnesses his balance and smooth stride to get there to seal attackers off to the wall, closes gaps quickly, and close soft spots by filling them. Willing to use his size to step up and into opponents, and will clear the front. He won’t seem anything but calm in his own end, even when you may think he need to be. The wild colt aspect about so many of this draft classes defenseman has been noted so much already, but this is yet another player who seems less inclined to play conservatively by holding back in transition. He wants to make the clean entry by his lonesome and is good at it! He wants to get the transitioned pucks and go back down so he can see the defending goalie's eyes -- then score. It is this all-in, I'm-gonna-win-it-for-us play. Many times it comes back and hurts his team, but there is so much to like about his abilities. Projects as a possible top 2 pairing NHLer whom you cannot deny on the carries. Takes chances to be the difference maker. There is high upside if he continues to grow his all around game. I know I would select him. Big physical blue line presence with keen two-way game and skill set. Displays big time physicality that sets the tone. A terrific skater with a booming shot. Decide to de-commit so that he might play in the OHL and maybe be a bit more desirable to NHL suitors...."
38,2018,Alexander Romanov,"Made his North American debut in the World Junior A Challenge. Surprised with his balance, footwork, lateral agility, strong pivots, lightning release and heavy shot. Uses his body in all three zones and will step into the opposition. Leans to hold off fore-checkers while he is moving on the attack. Creative carrier and passer who anticipates offensive flow. Supports the attack in his five man unit that expects him to get low if the opportunity opens. Did I mention his fancy foot work and ability to change directions? He stops and starts and almost always make crisp outlet passes from his end."
34,2018,Serron Noel,"Giant raw wing who isn’t close to the final sum of his parts. Has been on an upward spiral all season and this 200 plus pound, six foot five right winger is still working on foot speed, but has really good agility. Displays a good stick, and is starting to realize how he can dominate with his hands and big body to handle tight space. The comparison with past Q big forward Julien Gauthier stops right here; this giant wing has quick hands and some lateral ability, that separates him significantly. His long reach coupled with his long legged fluidity let’s him cover lots of ice in a shift. Goes to the net and has physical tools that might lead him to a strong NHL career. He’s never gonna be fast, but is strong on his pins, and uses his size to create time and space with an edgy game. Continues to improve his play away from the puck, and has room to add muscle all over, which will help him improve his movement."
30,2018,Joe Veleno,"He is the biggest wild card of the draft class. The first 15 year old granted exceptional status to play in the QMJHL and is in his third season in the “Q.”  Due to nagging injuries in his second season, his point totals were less than his rookie adjustment season. Draft prognosticators and his St. John Seadogs team were looking for big things this season, but he didn’t seem to be taking a qualitative jump as a dominant scorer. A change of scenery with a trade to Drummondville gave him a bit of a fresh start. Through the middle of March he still hadn’t reached the 20 goal mark but contributed more than 50 assists and has generated offense. No one can argue with his hockey IQ, sense, composure, and poise, or his commitment to being a 200 foot centre. He displays a good strong skating stride, and two step quickness at times. He’s got the size and will to compete. Reads the ice like a vet, can pass off and exchange the puck smoothly. Fearless and tough, he usually keeps an even keel -- but he's not going to be a intimidated. At this point, he's more of an offensive generator than high end scorer. The essential question is whether he has demonstrated elite level offensive skills and shooting ability to projects him as more than a complimentary offensive forward. How much of the exceptional status tag blocks honest evaluation? No matter. Whenever he comes off the board, his new team will be rewarded with “safe” player who will at very least play in the NHL."
32,2018,Mattias Samuelsson,"Big reliable defender who makes his money with simple up-ice plays and a very good job defending in his own end. This is a very large man child who is still growing. His skating is good, his balance is good and he gets plenty of power behind his point shot on the power play. His growing into his game and no one can predict the full upside as he may be a very large man. Understands what a big defender must do and continues to comply. The son of former Flyer 6’ 7 “Kjell Samuelsson, is committed to the University of Western Michigan. A big boy who plays big."
29,2018,Rasmus Sandin,"First year import who had the luxury of spending his season on one of the strongest teams in Canadian junior hockey. Has shown he is capable in all three zones, with really good hands that aid his alluding forecheckers and in his receiving hard passes. Although not a high end skater or overly agile East to West, he shows upside as puck carrier and attacker. He is a decent skater with a good sense of awareness and understanding of his end. Though he is new to the smaller ice surface, he can make the stretch pass. Will close off the wall with his body, and isn't afraid of contact. Smart defensively, as he picks his spots, when to pressure and when not to. Good at knowing his check as the attackers keep moving in and out of areas. Confident in his game and will carry the biscuit until he finds the right pass, without get it taken away. Not the finished product, he needs to improve his edging and strides in order to be faster and add some lateral mobility. Has nice long term potential."
28,2018,Nils Lundkvist,"Sometimes it takes playing with great teammates to bring out the best in a prospect. Thats what transpired with this kid when he was surrounded by the cream of the Swedish d-man crop at the Under-18 Five Nations tournament. Very smart in his decisions, good vision and execution. There is so much to his game that translates to high levels of competition. He is confident, has very good speed, and plays with edge with big hits. Hard worker on the defensive wall and the battle areas. Has the feet to expertly jump up into the play and activate, sometimes being the entry guy. Really good hands too. Puts pucks on the sticks of the right teammate. Arguably might have played better than Adam Boqvist, Adam Ginning, and Filip Johansson, and was a revelation."
27,2018,Nicolas Beaudin,"New age defender with good puck movement skills, nice foot speed, good hands and a good stick. Funnels attackers to the side boards, can make the secure outlet pass in transition. Very smart in all three zones. Has a soft touch, and excellent puck skills. Defensively and offensively aware and stays on the right side of the puck. His foot speed lets him control the speed of the game making nice touch passes. He walks the blue line and uses his deceptive snap passes to provide scoring looks. Sneaks downs and makes things happen. Will need to add strength as he develops."
37,2018,Jett Woo,"Ball of fire whose injury-riddled season had him sitting as an after thought out of the first round. As first look, he was looked at as strong defensive zone guy with a nice power play presence, but upon further investigation, appears to have sleeper in the first round. At six foot and a solid 200 pounds, you quickly see an aggressive all-around defenseman who read the options for his end, escapes a strong forecheck, and targets teammates on the way out. Uses his defensive partner well when he goes ""d to d."" Probably a bit under-rated on the offensive side. A quick ""touch and pass"" player in the offensive zone who gets the puck to his own open attackers. Will pinch down along the wall much to the chagrin of the opposition, trying to gain possession. This young man, named after martial artist, displays Jet Li core strength, and relished contact in compact space. He seems the winner in each and every physical confrontation. Besides being a devastating contact player that instills enough respect that opponents try to avoid hit hits, he has a very quick stick, breaking up passes in both the neutral and defensive zones. Unheralded offensively at this juncture, he reads and finds teammates on their way to passing lanes. Displays smarts and patience when at the top of the umbrella on the power play. The season wasn't kind to him, nor were many of the evaluations, because he might have been playing hurt or ""careful"" due to his injury. This is a player who may be off the board earlier than many expect."
24,2018,Filip Johansson,"Another of the top four Swedish blue liners that wowed at the Under-18 Five Nations Tournament. Ranks right up there with the other three in terms of effectiveness up and down the sheet. Plays a simple game but has no qualms activating in a less spectacular fashion than the others. Displays a high IQ in the defensive zone. Has quick feet in transition up ice and back down to his end, backing up the attack. Makes good breakouts and anticipates where the plays are going. Has work to do on his gap control as he gives attackers too much time and space. Has a long reach which impedes attackers and helps reach errant passes and pucks."
33,2018,Jonatan Berggren ,"Undersized winger-center with quickness, hands, and an penchant for generating offense. The best player on the Swedish team in the recent World Under-18s, he creates lots of scoring looks shift after shift. A really good stickhandler with excellent lateral agility at high speed. He is a heavy traffic player who can turn a defender  inside out, go wide and then cut in or simply keep backing him up. Gets separation with his carries and is willing to finish checks, or take a hit to make a play. Very fast when he gains possession in the corner on the attack. Displays a strong snap shot, and fast hands when setting up his linemates."
31,2018,Alexander Alexeyev,"Big Russian import who has really improved the pace at which he plays in all phases. Rangy defender with footwork, who can transport through the neutral zone in a few strides. Strong on the puck as he protects it well whenever he is in possession. Uses his size to take back pucks and disturb attackers.  Polished enough to not hold the biscuit too long, and uses his soft hands to get it tape to tape to teammates. Displays a really low heavy power play point shot, that can be targeted for deflecting. His long reach helps pull in errant pass returns, and he keeps the puck moving emblematic of the new era role of the backliners."
26,2018,Jacob Bernard-Docker,"Solid defense prospect who does the little things that lead to success, without flash and dash, or an advanced offensive game.  An excellent head that goes hand in hand with excellent feet. A strong short area burst that will slip him by the initial line of defense. Catches the opposition napping with his quick cuts and knows how to effectively slow play down. Really high IQ and effectiveness in his decisions. Has a nice low shot he gets off with some mustard. Is really advanced with his gap control, angling off and mirroring of opponents in the course of their attacks. Makes solid transition passes and looks to have high-end upside as he progresses through the college ranks. Committed to the University of Notre Dame."
21,2018,Ryan Merkley,"Outstanding push attacking defenseman with dynamic speed and agility. High end puck skills and a keen hockey IQ that lets him highlight his offensive gifts. A wild colt that doesn’t hesitate to take on entrance into the attack zone, he somewhat ignores his linemates. Confident he can stickhandle and flash though to start the attack zone looks. Part of his bronco-like behaviors spills out with an attitude that rubs many the wrong way. He has really good vision and is an offensive leader with his carries, passes, and lateral movements -- creating space in the offensive zone. Has little trouble seeing that open man at the other blue line and can thread the needle with the breakaway pass. He is physically strong and aggressive. Really good puck distributer in the attack-zone. Another of the valuable right-handed shooting defenders teams covet. The downside is (as is with so many of the undersized fast and skilled attacking defenseman): he is a liability as defenseman -- pure and simple. It’s not so much that the riverboat gambler mentality is the cause of his defensive shortcomings either. He doesn’t seem to understand coverage or read the attacking teams. He puts himself in many situations were he has to play undisciplined and garnishes unwanted penalties. The scouting staff of team drafting in that third tier range will have to watch tons of tape and decide if the good outweighs the bad. You can teach defense whereas you cannot teach the high end skills he possesses. I am sure the team that selects him will have a scheme to protect him in his end, and move forth from there. Teams must feel comfortable that he eventually starts applying team-building behaviors to his behaviors with others."
25,2018,Dominik Bokk,"German winger blessed with good size and hands. Was relegated to a smaller role and spare part on the powerful Vaxjo Lakers Champions League finalist team.  At times looks like an outstanding developmental prospect who can send the opposition reeling by going to the front and driving through traffic. Has a good hockey IQ and excellent vision. With his high end passing ability teams are viewing him as a really nice late first round option. His soft hands thread the needle with the best of them, when dishing to his linemates with intensity by way of both his forehand and backhand. When he shows inspired play in traffic between the dots, he is moving and shooting with regularity. The issue is the consistency at which he displayed these efforts. Can look disinterested and not willing to get involved for long stretches. Teams look towards the prospects that come to play sixty minutes, even if they may have less skill than many who don't play up to there potential. But teams also hope to change hearts and minds as maturity takes place. For me, this young German lad is a toss-up."
20,2018,Rasmus Kupari,"Solid centre-wing with top end speed, a superb stride, and lateral agility. Why his name isn't being noted is puzzling as he is an aggressive knock'em-down-to-get-back-the-puck speedster who projects as an attacking left winger. His elite burst gets him in top gear very quickly and changes direction rapidly. Aggressively gets in for the forecheck, and will use his body to separate pucks from the opposition in the offensive zone. Creative in the attack zone, he makes nice feeds and is best when he has open ice to work in. Projects as a centre, but probably ends staying on the wing because he is not a high end stickhandler set up guy. Hands are quicker shooting than handling but can lose pucks in tight. Is able to cover lots of ice each shift, and does. He has an excellent shot. Needs to get better in his decision making, reads, and become a more consistent player. The fact he shuttled from Liiga, Junior A SM-liiga and Mestis and was asked to also shuttle between wing and centre didn’t help his progress. His lack of production this past year will see his draft value drop, but there is still much to like about this prospect."
19,2018,Jay O'Brien,"A late bloomer with good skills, feet, and high end stickhandling ability. Six foot playmaking centre with very good offensive instincts and smarts. Has good vision and sees the open teammate quickly and effectively. Has a good anchor and is strong on the puck. Has a frame that can add weight. Has a terrific stick, and despite knocks on his skating stride by others, he provides scoring chances using his speed and agility. The issue is more if you are able to get value by where he is selected. His lack of production in past years is a troubling aspect if you see him as player who is going to trend upward. As an NHLer, he'll be expected to contribute as a regular contributor offensively. Committed to Providence College."
17,2018,Ty Smith,"The biggest differences between this undersized, fast, and skilled offensive defender, and the players surrounding him in the rankings is that he's a left shot and is a very responsible in his own end. He already defends better than Boqvist and Hughes... despite his undersized frame. Another elite skater with terrific edge work and poise beyond his years. Needs to get thicker and stronger, but has learned to play nimble and smart against the bigger attackers. He handles the puck at a very high skill level and lights it on his stick. A tad under six foot and about 175 pounds, he manages to elevate his game and play a solid 200 foot game despite his limitations. Before February 1st he was at a point per game pace in the Dub. A character player, offensive generator, and PP QB."
22,2018,K'Andre Miller,"Converted forward who is a large physical defense-first defender who is nearly 200 pounds. Very good in motion as a puck carrier, can shoot the puck as a point man or when he activates as part of the attack. Uses his size to and length against attackers and lets the opposition know he is there near the blue paint. Responsible in his end, makes sound decisions, a good outlet pass, but gets in trouble with his stop/starts, or when caught not moving. Passes well in all phases and reads his end well, using his teammates on the way out. Will let his big shot go while pressing in the attack zone and opens up with a hard fast one-timer.  Still learning the nuances of the backline and is quite smart at trying to do things as simple as possible at this point. As he improves his feet, he might gain more assertiveness going up ice through the middle zone with zone enrties. At this point projects as a bottom four defender. Committed to the University of Minnesota."
15,2018,Grigori Denisenko,"Russian playmaking winger with excellent on-ice vision, high-end hands and stick. Was the best player at the World Junior A Challenge. Projects as a high end scorer, but will need to be less generous with the puck on the attack to actually turn into a big time scorer. Is such a good precise passer and his stop/starts are so clean he gains time to diagnose which teammate should receive his pinpoint pass. He has high end dangle and deception skills, and seems to be able to take games over. At very least looks to me a cut above everyone else on the ice sheet. And this isn't a Vladimir Tarasenko; ready and willing to work on the back end, no quit when the tide is running strong against him. He isn't a 100% each shift guy and can sour you by what seems to be disinterest at times. He has got that same Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde you saw in Alexander Semin, so there is lots to consider with this prospect. The real key when selecting Russians who aren't already over in North America is they may not want to make the jump  under the rookie salary cap constraints; they can make plenty of money while staying at home and waiting until the teams that draft them are no longer subject to the entry-level contract rules. Sometimes these Russian players slip into the later parts of the selection process unless they plan to come now and stay -- no matter if they make the parent clubs right away."
14,2018,Joel Farabee,"Smart three zone playmaker with an abundance of excellent characteristics and tools that point him upward as a solid NHL winger. Presently a six foot lightweight (well under 170lbs) who has high end awareness, terrific shift to shift work ethic, and simply makes plays all over the sheet. Playing against same age competition, he easily grades out as above-average. A strong balanced skater who effectively masks his skating gears. He causes opponents issues when he has the puck and on defense when he has any chance of gaining it back. When he does make things happen, he diagnoses and makes a well laid quick pass to cause sudden momentum changes the other way. His hockey IQ tips the scale in his favor, whether he is playing against a tight defensive opponent, in a fast pace back-and-forth barn stormer, or when things get chippy. A really good penalty killer, and might be on the ice during any situation. Excellent with the puck on his stick, strong and quick to find and use his options. Has a good release; as he gets stronger, I am sure his shot will get heavier. Fearless and relentless attacker, who creates time and space to advance pucks to his linemates or cut through traffic with an accurate surprise shot. Some might argue that being on the USNTDP first line with scorer Oliver Wahlstrom has help him standout, but I think that the argument also works in the opposite direction, as this kid is a non-stop offensive generator who wills wins with his high energy commitment to victory. What teams will have to do is project just where he fits in a pro line-up. Is there upside as the competition ramps up? Or does the team that selects him come away happy they are getting a NHL package, that can be a complimentary piece as opposed to dominant first line force? Committed to Boston University."
23,2018,Isac Lundeström,"While still being eligible for the draft class, that didn't stop him from centering the first line of Sweden's World Junior Tournament silver medal winning team. Dependable, reliable and responsible are what scouts thought a year ago, and only solidified that opinion this season with strong work in the faceoff circle. Decent use of his size, skating ability and smarts while on the ice. Very versatile as he can line up at any of the three forward positions, the power play, and  penalty kill. Works hard, drives the net, pressures the opposing defensemen, and creates turnovers. Drives to the net, and is decent in the defensive zone. The team that takes him is making a safe selection based on his all-around attributes that point upward."
18,2018,Liam Foudy,"This kid will work his way up to being a solid third liner in the NHL. Where he gets selected is the big debate.  Displays great speed and balance and simply takes away time from defenders, wining most pucks. An athlete whose scoring should continue to improve. Was one of the better two-way scorers in the OHL by the end of the season."
11,2018,Oliver Wahlstrom,"Big forward is one of the premier scorers in the United States Development Team. A big bodied, fluid skating attacker who is apt at carrying the on zone entries. He finds time and space while carrying the puck and has a good wall presence. Creatively generates offense to his teammates. Is able to play all three forward position (although he hasn't been asked to play in the pivot position) and is very comfortable as an off-handed wing. Has shown high end shooting ability and has the goals to prove it. Slips into the soft areas and gets the one-timers. Has a really fine trigger, whether it is from the periphery, or when he is given looks in-closer to use his wrist shot. His speed and shot are usually the first two mentions he gets, but his vision, and creativity rank high, despite his shoot-first mentality at the amateur level.  Has been on the radar as a top U.S prospect for some time, so with that has been many views and scouts tend to see him as an established “reliable” prospect. Not some new best thing, so he may last a bit longer than expected if teams don’t see him as a top scoring centre prospect. I see him as an NHL left winger who needs to add more edge, finish checks, and provides two way play starting in your top six with decent upside towards it."
16,2018,Martin Kaut,"High-end skater with top end speed, separation, and skills. Uses his elite puck handling and stick skills to blow out of his defensive zone, and will back up the defenders when he quickly gets to attacking zone blueline. Lethal shooter who can target the corners, jump on the rebounds and even deflect shots from the point. Has a deceptive way of stick-handling and disguises when he releases his shots. Will use defenders as screens in the process. Very imaginative in his strategies and passes. There is much to like, but seems a bit disinterested in his own end and when his team gets behind or out-matched."
13,2018,Ty Dellandrea,"Displays excellent skill set, good size and giddy-up. Wins puck battles and is responsible in his own end. Has a strong two-way game. Moves well with deceptive quickness. Has been stuck on Flint with no help for two seasons. If the World Juniors Under-18 showed us anything, it was that he quickly meshed with different line-mates and outworked the opposition night after night. Grinds away whether it be keeping pucks alive on the offense or with dogged forechecking to turn the puck over.  Excellent vision and playmaking ability. A developing player who makes it easy for his wingers and is still blossoming as a scorer."
8,2018,Adam Boqvist,"This draft will be marked with an unprecedented number of highly sought after skilled attacking defensemen who are average or under-sized with little physicality. This player compensates for it with terrific hands and ability to push the pace, doing a decent job in his own end using his skill set. In the Swedish junior league, Boqvist showcased a nice shot, high end speed, and agility. He may very well be the top finesse and fine-edge-skating defenseman in the draft, displaying great balance and lateral mobility. He is lightning fast and has great vision. He distributes the puck unselfishly and he jumps in on the attack -- sometimes leading it. He opens up and delivers a very accurate one timer. As a slight, smaller player, he gets overtaken, losing puck battles to the bigger players. Does show good vision in both ends but it is a bigger challenge in his own end. His fast feet help negate some of his problems in the defensive zone, but it is difficult to ignore his defensive zone positioning issues. As a lightweight anchor, he needs to fill out, get stronger, and build his defensive game. Another right handed shooting mobile defenseman."
7,2018,Quinton Hughes,"Undersized defender in the Kris Letang mold who plays strong at both ends. This Michigan Wolverine had a very successful freshman season as an undersized offensive defenseman. About five foot ten, he has one of the highest hockey IQ in this class. Moreover, he is one of the fastest and most agile skaters at his position with the jump to not only get to top gear rapidly, but gear down to a complete stop to reverse or change direction -- slowing down the ice and controlling the play with the ""freeze."" He has been heralded for years as a player destined to be selected in the top couple selections. He displays elite feet, balance and edge work. He wants the puck on his stick on zone entries and even chooses to skate the puck solo when the puck transitions to him in his defensive zone. He is so fast that he is able to jump in on the attack on most offensive forays. Always looking for the dynamic pass to set up a goal, the competitive nature in all zones is terrific and fearless. The team that drafts him knows he will use his stick positioning, feet, and lateral quickness to defend, and will fall short against stronger bigger attackers who will win the majority of physical confrontations. A team drafting him will have to devise a plan to protect him in his end, maybe even pull back the reins."
6,2018,Filip Zadina,"At six foot and 190, he is a dynamic scoring wing who just keeps getting scoring chances-- and capitalizes on them. Solid skater with lateral agility, but he isn’t a blazer, so he exploits the seams & soft spots in coverage. Displays quick hands and a scorers mentality, but doesn’t necessarily use his agility as a one trick pony in the attack zone. He is responsible in all three zones and is competitive in backside pressure. His forte is on the power play; he is able to generate chances, get to soft areas, and use his head and hands to shoot the puck. Has a wicked one-timer, and a quick release - cannon of a snap shot. Has been an elite attacker in the QMJHL. Very patient and has a smart sense about where he should be in the attacking zone. He can beat you with a surprising heavy perimeter shot, or simply gets in closer and sniffs around for scores in the area. Seems to swoop into existing puck battles and come out untouched, quickly moving into the blue dot. He makes the goalie start changing his position and takes advantage with his sneaky backhand or quick wrister. He lit up the World Juniors U-20 for Czech with seven goals in seven games at 18 years of age. He has emerged as one of the top picks in the class because his fiery offensive capabilities may continue to develop into the pro game. And I don't think moving him to left wing compromises his ability to score and make plays. A pure shooter, who can change a game with one flick of his wrists.."
5,2018,Barrett Hayton,"Big kid who continues to show a high skill set and a dedication day-to-day to improve on his last performance. A complete player who takes pride in his 200 foot game, has high hockey IQ, and solid playmaking ability in the attack zone. He has little trouble finding and feeding his best option in the offensive zone. Plays both PK and PP. Three inches smaller than Jordan Staal -- a player he compares to nicely. There is plenty to like about him in terms of his commitment and continuing improvement. You draft him knowing he doesn’t project as a top line impact center; just a guy the coach will love because he can play in all situations and slide in anywhere in the bottom nine and make the guys around him better. Selfless, serious, high IQ guy in the offensive end, drawing more than one attacker to him, only to deceptively get the puck to an open teammate. He is a scoring threat every shift with his heavy shot, but isn’t gonna wow you. He quietly and effectively gets his job done in all three zones or with his snap shot."
4,2018,Brady Tkachuk,"May be the best of the second generation players since than Brett Hull; he usually leads his team whether it be BU, or Team USA in all phases, but can be counted on to be a consistent physical presence. The nicest kid you would ever want to meet off the ice, but transforms when he skates onto the ice. He refuses to let up or stop being physically involved. He has great balance and solid skating abilities. Possess decent speed and agility. He showed his ability in the World Junior U-20 where he won puck battle after puck battle and set up a number of big goals, notable late-game tying and winning goals in the round robin against both Canada and Slovakia. Combines his long stride with very good stick-handling prowess and long reach. He is able to make time for linemates with his possessions. Extremely creative and shows finesse in his set ups, but more importantly his demeanor is such that he takes the responsibility of winning on his shoulders. He has a high upside, not a limited ceiling that some suggest. Can dominate down low and between the dots. Retrieves pucks by way of physical checks and honest wall work. There are no warts in his game, and he has shown in college games that he can play and dominate against older more developed young men. He isn't the fastest player from a dead start, but good enough in a straight line to fill holes, block shots, and position himself as a threat in more ways than one. There is no denying by any scout that the offensive skills are there, and will grow. No growth is necessary as a team guy and possible future NHL captain. When he is promoted to the NHL, he will be a plug and play stand alone player who can compete and win, no matter where/who he plays with. He is a player who never quits and wills his team to win through his actions. And boy, does he have some edge!"
3,2018,Jesperi Kotkaniemi,"Is he your future power winger or your big centre? He can be such high end puck hander and a tank-like aggressive force with his work in the crease area. He can also defend away from the puck, or be so strong on the puck. But surely when he was finally elevated to first line centre in the U-18 Worlds, he showed a high end potential. Did that now project him as a forceful, physical future NHL centre? The fact that he is very proficient in the face-off circle might have NHL scouting staffs figuring he should get ample chances to develop as a pivot. Strong on his skates in his possessions and very effective on the defensive side. Needs a step to get going and is straight line attacker, but is patient and sneaky with a good wrist shot, and possesses the ability to gift-wrap pucks to teammates. The team that drafts him will be hopeful he continues to build leg strength and fill in fully. Lots to like about his vision and hockey smarts and upside."
9,2018,Vitali Kravtsov,"A big winger with very good straight line speed, balance, quick feet, and scoring ability. While his numbers in the KHL were nothing to take notice of, the fact that he was on the first team power play says much for how he is thought of. He still needs to make use of his linemates, understand how to use his speed as a device to set up the five man attack, and needs to keep adding strength. Plays aggressive, hard, and with grit, projecting as a power forward. A creative three zone player who was able to impose his will and be on equal footing with grown men in the KHL. He will only get stronger and more dynamic.  There certainly is enough there for teams to consider him as a highly skilled prospect that wouldn't be available late in the first..."
0,2019,Alexei Protas,"Huge young Belarusian import centre with an . excellent stick, a big body and soft hands and playmaking skills. Creative with his stick-handling and stays focused in the scoring areas even his he is draped by defenders. His reach helps shield the puck and can put on a show with his stick-handling. His skating and edging is a work in progress as is his conditioning. projects as a long term developmental prospect."
2,2018,Andrei Svechnikov,"Spent significant time out of Barrie's line up with  a wrist injury, but ranks as the top forward on my list. That's due not only to his scoring ability, but also his ability to generate looks on the attack in many ways. Despite his injury, he's still second among all CHL rookie prospects in terms of points per game. Possesses good size, a lightning quick release, and a resume that includes a 30 goal season as a 15 year old in Russia, a 29 goal, 58 point in 48 games in the USHL as a 17 yr old, and 36 points in 21 games with Barrie this season."
0,2019,Lukas Parik,"Cool Czech goalie who stands tall and makes save after save with composure. Displays an excellent glove good athleticism and in the Under-18s, he stifiles Jack Hughes on two breakaways. (That should count in his favor.)"
0,2019,Dillon Hamaliuk,"Big wing who has been hampered by injury caused by a kneeing infraction, probably concussion related. He projects as a power forward with pace who gets to the front, and finishes checks with physicality. Kills penalties."
10,2018,Evan Bouchard,"Big impact defender who some have categorized as a power play specialist, although I think that is understating his overall game and upside. Has been at the top or close to the top in defenseman scoring this entire year in the OHL. He was named captain of his club, and plays really smart in both ends. Has good balance and good four-direction skating ability, despite not being categorized as an agile lateral mover with a big burst up ice. Thinks the game at an elite level, and in March was leading his team in scoring. Has little problem getting involved up ice on the rush and is very comfortable using his skill set and decision-making to create from the blue line. He has an excellent hard point shot, but always looks for the best pass too. Skates a bit upright, but it doesn’t hamper his vision or coolness in his own end and when things are starting to develop on the offensive. The sport has reached a skill level where there is a division that separates the position of defenseman into two distinct type styles, and at this point, Bouchard falls into the ""has decent size and power, but lacks that lightning speed"" side. Still developing, he projects as a right-side backline leader who continues to grow his game to where he achieves high pair NHL status."
12,2018,Noah Dobson,"Plays both ends of the ice very well. Has a good frame and will continue to grown into it and get bigger, and surely he will become less shy playing like a larger guy. Already better then most “Q” defenders at using his mobility, reach, stick, and to have his stick on the right side of the puck carrier. Deceptively fast and always willing to lug the biscuit up ice. Because he is bigger and his stride is so fluid, he catches you off guard with how fast he can accelerate and then surprises again when he executes at top speed. Jumps up from the blue line deep in to the attack zone and has the speed to get himself back up ice. Has a slapper he keeps low and a strong accurate wrist shot. You would like a bit more physicality and see him push attackers off the puck. While he shows he can separate players from the puck decently although, they won’t be looking to see if he is coming next shift. Has already shown enough to be considered a top half of the first round candidate, but I have concerns he might not have the elite quickness and ""head"" speed to become a top NHL impact defenseman."
0,2019,Cade Webber,Defender with a huge wingspan and frame. Displays a powerful skating stride that allows this big man to carry the puck up ice and set the zone entries. A developmental prospect who will gain confidence in his abilities to generate offense and hones his gifts. Committed to Boston University
0,2019,Pyotr Kochetkov,"Was a revelation at the Word Junior U-20 as this third year eligible has solidly put his name in the conversation as an NHL goalie prospect. A cool, calm, confident competitor with great size, soft pads and long legs that take away the bottom of the net. Agressively challenges shooters and plays big."
0,2019,Marshall Warren,Committed to Harvard University.
0,2019,Zachary Jones,"Natural hockey talent who is undersized and only 170 plus pounds but gifted with four direction skating ability, excellent straight ahead speed and and an aggressive offensive frame of mind. A high end skater adept at jumping on loose pucks, and skating them from his end and also hits the outlet with sharpness. Can make the stretch pass and his elusive in his carries. Can skate around defenders. In his end he will chip pucks around opposing players. Comfortable with holding pucks to draw the opposition to him. Adept at handing pucks with both sides of his blade, and have different gears and good glide in transport."
0,2019,Henry Rybinski,"Forced a trade out of Medicine Hat, but didn’t sit home until occurred; he went to the BCHL boasting the second best scoring totals there until he was finally traded to Seattle. Offensive forward with a solid game away from the puck. Has good size, speed and shot."
1,2018,Rasmus Dahlin,"What else can I say that hasn't been said about Rasmus Dahlin. The team selecting first overall will not hesitate at the chance to select who might be the best prospect at the defense position in the last decade. It's easy to argue that most National Hockey League teams really don't have true number one defenseman, just players talented enough to play big minutes and do a decent job. Some of these number one defenders are average or under-sized players that push the pace and do a decent job in their own end. This young man, however, is capable of being a true number one, based on his stature, terrific puck skills, four-way skating ability, and an edge that sets him a notch above rookie status the first time he hits NHL ice."
0,2019,Nikola Pasic,"Smaller wing with a nice skill set ability to control the action in tight spaces and dangle with the best of them. Can get his shot releases in closed quarters. He has little interest in the corners, and doesn’t always come to play each night or shift. There is skill there…"
0,2019,Antti Tuomisto,Big Finnish defender with improved skating and puck handling skills
0,2019,Nando Eggenberger,"Big and strong Swiss wing who is a deceptively strong and quick attacker. Appears in close whenever he chooses to do so. Already stronger than most in his Swiss league, he creates chances along the wall and down low. He has a sniper's hands from the perimeter and hockey sense to find the open areas. This big horse gallops in from nowhere and lets it go with an offensive stampede. or swings out from behind the goal line. Prototypical power wing with size, shot, balance, and nice North-South skating ability. Not pretty, just effective. Plays on special teams with success and has a great defensive presence at both ends. Wins puck battle on the wall and in the corners. Has a goal scorers touch and is very difficult to move off the puck. A solid penalty-killer who diagnoses well. It was a revelation a year and half ago in the World Junior Under-20 where he took on the role of a power winger. Made the transition to the North Americia in the OHL and has continued to show his value in that role. Unselfish and makes positive things happen when he is carrying."
0,2019,Ethan Keppen,"Projects as power forward who uses his body along the wall, in front and down low. Displays a very strong stride and first couple steps. Will slide to the front and be a moving screen as his team sets for a shot, and spread and anchor looking for the deflection. After winning pucks in the greasy areas, gets loose and he lets loose a heavy accurate shot. More than willing to fight for lost pucks and plays hard away from the puck."
0,2019,Roman Basran,Roman Basran G
0,2019,Zachary Okabe,"Super soft hands puck control at his top gear and nice East-West speed and elusiveness. The knock is that he is only five foot eight inches, but it his diminutive size doesn’t diminish his high end vision, soft hands and light edges.  His offensive instincts a speediness help him back of defenders and he is excellent at hitting his teammates with precision passes. He has citizenship in Australia, Japan and is working on getting his Canadian citizenship.  Okabe declared his verbal commitment to play for St. Cloud State."
0,2019,Taylor Gauthier,Goalie prospect with good rebound control and flexibility who thrived through a heavy workload. Has solid control on his skates and mover side to side well. Closes down the openings on the side posts and reads the action really well. Solid upper body that allows him to transport side to side without dropping down. Good paddle to close the five hole and can go to full splits more than adequately. Exhibits a strong positional game to develop upon.
0,2019,Nikita Okhotuk,"Promising Russian rearguard with a heavy slap shot. Already understands his position and displays good feet, defensive recognition and the calm ability to make defensive plays.  Has a very good back pedal and an excellent pivot. Solid in the middle zone and closes down the space on attackers before they get a head of steam. Not afraid to take responsibility with the puck in his end find a way to slip out of the zone whether it is a smart pass or a carry. He is a good skater who quickly gets going in his starts from stops. Opens his hips and lets the puck fly from the point. Russian backline import who has a nice two-way game, good functional strength and powerful four direction skater. Started the year missing games due to injury, but came back to nicely transition back in and there are glimpses of some real offensive potential there.Far from the finished product, there are many questionable instances that he still lacks sound decision-making skills or that he is not yet reading the ice well. He has big frame and pins players to the wall, and has time to grow his game."
0,2019,Jake Lee,"Long term developmental defender with nice size and girth. Has skills but may need a bit more time to steady them and adjust to the higher speed of the advanced levels he will be graduating into. Needs to make better decisions with and without the puck, handle the puck with more certainty and get stronger at handling the outside attackers then beat him to the inside. Still there is something there to like as he works on improving."
0,2019,Radek Muzik,Captained the Czech Republic team at the Five Nations U-18 who has size puck-handling skills and some edge. plays off wing and is still growing into his big frame. Needs to us his physical gifts on the forecheck.
0,2019,Hunter Jones,Has size and athleticism and is a solid technician between the pipes. Balances stance and a good cross crease slide. Tracks the puck well but needs to cut down angles on attackers by aggressively moving further out.
0,2019,Antti Saarela,"Quite well thought of, but projects as a long developmental center when still needs time to strengthen his overall game. Thought of as a gifted guy with smart instincts, with good energy and stick skills, but that might be a premature assessment. At the Five Nations Under-18 his zone entries were thwarted on zone entires with puck losses. Was given first line responsibilities but neglected his defensive end responsibilities after he was stifled on the attack. Took a needless kneeing penalty against Russia a got a one game suspension. All this doesn’t close the book on him, just points to a need for more maturity in his on ice demeanor and in his game and skill development."
0,2019,Marcus Kallionkieli,"Finnish import with good size, excellent stick and outstanding upside as a player with natural instinct as a scorer. Has a big time deadly shot, willingness to use his size to achieve his end, and he drives hard to the front. Will need to develop habit more pace to his game and start moving his pins and did into the battle area."
0,2019,Josh Williams,"Solid built goal scoring winger who played the season without the luxury of a quality set up man. Goal scoring winger with a high IQ, who finds the soft areas and coverage and ends up getting some nice looks. Very strong and can bull over defenders and strong on the cycle creating looks when he moves out from the corner. Might have the hardest velocity shot in the class, a quick release but only 14 total goals to show for it. The adage is make your own chances, and unfortunately he was unable to surrounded by two different WHL squads."
0,2019,Shane Pinto,"Developing centre reman with good size and feet, decent vision and creativity and passing savvy, but still putting the other pieces in place. A willing worker but has to improve his release, and his effectiveness in greasy areas and not play soft on the forecheck and in the battle zones. Committed to the University of North Dakota."
0,2019,Blake Murray,Big centre-wing who can explode off his edges into the play gets faster while in motion. Distributes the puck well
0,2019,Anttoni Honka,"Billed as a clone of his brother, another smaller undersized defender who could push the pace of a game. The chinks in the armor started showing up when he started getting lost in coverage and unable to contend with the the bigger players in International play. In the World Junior he looked out of place in that he didn’t seem to be able to pivot along with the attackers so they blew by him. We will not see the end of smaller offensmen being heralded based on their forward push, but the true success will come as they climb the higher levels and show competency in using their feet sticks and positioning to defend."
0,2019,Martin Hugo Has,Martin Hugo Has
0,2019,Rhett Pitlick,"His dad, Lance went from a five seasons in the NHL to a product line to help young hockey players improve their stickhandling and transitioned to coaching kids on stick handling and shooting. His youngest son might be his biggest benefactor. Has high end skills and hockey sense. All season he has continued to grow, get stronger and faster on the ice. Joined Omaha and scored in his first game, and has not looked out of place as an offensive weapon there. Committed to the University of Minnesota."
0,2019,Yegor Serdyuk,"Under the radar import who has gotten little buzz but quietly averaged over a point a game. Not six foot or over 170 lbs., but nonetheless drives the play with his feet, reads the ice and uses his talents to be very creative and a difference maker. Moves fluidly through the traffic and able to beat defenders one on one. Long term developmental defenseman."
0,2019,Henri Nikkanen,"Big centre with good size and an effective passing game along with solid defensive instincts Projects as a p[ossible bottom six player based on his penalty-killing, and his experience playing in the Finnish men’s league. Keeps things simple."
0,2019,Matej Blümel,"Second year eligible player who surprisingly was not selected last year. ""The most impressive Czech player in the Five Nations U-18. a year ago. He is an explosive skater who needed time to adjust to the new surroundings of an experienced Waterloo USHL club. Works hard to use his speed to separate, find seams, and forecheck. His shot is coming along and is a dangerous player when on the ice in short-handed situations. Committed to the University of Connecticut."""
0,2019,Ilya Nikolayev,Six foot thick centreman who has a strong first step and bursts that glide him into the soft areas on the attack. Good balanced skater with a bowlegged base but it doesn’t deter him from controlling the middle of the ice in three zones responsibly. A very soft passer who is slick in his movements before he dishes. Displays fast hands and quick burst explosions as he comes out from the corners and wall.
0,2019,Daniil Gutik,"Can stickhandle and move on the attack fairly well and despite average feet and agility still has some dangle to his game His primary negative is his skating which still is a work in progress. Has a good shot, and probably is yet another long term Russian investment a team makes, looking for a later reward."
0,2019,Robert Mastrosimone,"“Maestro” is a high energy wing that plays in all situation bringing it each and every shift, and leads by example. Has excellent vision and is sneaky in the attack zone, drawing opponents and then creating looks through teammates. Plays fast, shift and with high energy and some sandpaper each shift. Displays a really quick shot, and attacks the opponents to take back pucks in defensive end, and is relentless in the defensive end back checking, lifting the puck carrier’s stick to unearth the pick. An accomplish penalty killer who is 200 foot unselfish with the puck. A deceptive skater who can lull defenders and crank his acceleration into higher gear. A lightweight, but too much to like about him to not think he gets selected and might find a way into the bigs. May not be the most diligent in all zones, or very physical, but when it comes offense, he is the fuse that lights the powder keg. Committed to Boston University."
0,2019,Yegor Spiridonov,"Every viewing of this solid Russian centreman had been positive even though he is not considered a big time impact prospect, just a physical one who takes care of business efficiently one at both ends of the ice, with a technically sound and responsible game while the marquee guys gets the glory. He is always there to lend a hand to his defenders and is tall and a rangy skating style that allows him to carry and eat up ice. He is rugged and takes hit to make plays, will hold the biscuit that extra second to freeze defenders and allow teammates to fill the soft areas. A tenacious penalty-killer, he has yet to show strong offensive upside. If this player was part of a North American program he would be heralded and taken a lot earlier. Lots to like as a team’s later round investment."
0,2019,Ilya Mironov,"Like so many of the “Russian factor” players, he falls into the category of the prospects we can wait for and will take a chance on later in the draft. I am not sure if a team invests in his stock, since his is a bit of an enigma: a defender oozing with a load of physical tools but so far is showing little growth in his understanding of what playing defense entails. He is a long term developmental prospect who will be called upon to start growing at his position."
0,2019,Samuel Fagemo,"After a strong summer at the Ivan Hlinka tourney, injuries beset this quick winger. Although he a good come-back scoring 19 goals and 30 points in 37 SuperElite games for Frölunda he also potted 5 goals in 5 playoff games.  A scorer with a quick release and strong shot. That has resulted in less team-orientated attack when he  is on the sheet. With him  putting blinders onto his options and taking low percentage shots that result in possession changes. I understand the scorer mentality but he takes it a bit too far.  Takes many shots from outside the perimeter as if he doesn't yet understand or care about the idea of working the puck down in. Improving Swedish winger who has developed through the luxury of playing with quality line mates. Under six foot, but thick,  he sees time on the power play and had started to develop a strong 200 foot game. He’s have a bit of sniper in him, as his quick release is pretty accurate. Will receive a pass and let it fly on net in one motion. Deft passer who can saucer it to his teammates in flight. Good development project at wing. There is enough talent to think he will get chosen while teams try and patiently hone his hockey IQ."
0,2019,Michal Teplý,"Big off-hand left winger with soft hands, great physical attributes and an improved skating gear and footwork. Handles passes and in the Five Nations U-17, had a hat trick against the Finns. Improving as an attacker as his legs and hands are coming together. He has good vision and now is playing at a confident tempo. His co-ordination has progressed and was surprisingly physical against the Russians and applied strong forechecking pressure throughout the match. Lets go with dangerous shots through heavy traffic. Just through open ice and his solid edging helps him cut out of traffic for a good look. He is still filling his frame in."
0,2019,Mads Søgaard,"Giant Danish goaler who is quite agile and flexible. Covers much of the open net and is able in a crouch, take away the bottom, then propel himself in a cross net push to the other post. Looks awkward when standing tall, but is quite athletic enough to shuffle through his positioning despite his massive upper body. Nice developmental goalie who might eventually surprise as a big leaguer."
0,2019,Layton Ahac,"Long lean defender who wasn’t afforded as much situational ice time to raise him to the upper echelons of the draft class, but he shows terrific feet,  nice jump, very good offensive talents. Reads the ice and sees those hard to anticipate seam passes and pinpoints them, while in motion. Good size and athletic enough to continue to develop into a solid defender as well as a mailman. Might have the lightest edging in the class, he is a long term project that has a high water mark. Committed to Ohio State University."
0,2019,Albin Grewe,"Perpetual motion fireball of a wing with non stop speed, motion and intensity. Has terrific vision, compete level and seems to always come out of the high battle areas with the puck. Leading his junior team scoring by virtue of his skillful hands, his moves, and his abiilty to make successful passes in high traffic areas. His strong push on his wheels get him past defenders like he is bulling his way where he wants. Always moving in his low to ice stance, he dekes you, and makes time to thread the puck to an open teammate. Players like this are a nightmare to defend, and he still will score when double-covered. Displays a lightning-fast release. One of the best forwards in the Under-18 Five Nations tourney on a team filled with older players from the 2018 class."
0,2019,Daniil Misyul,"Tall lean attacking defenseman who is fluid on his pins, very patience and fearless in his carries down low. Fits in the definition of a new age attacker who picks his spots and activates into the mix, looking at the best option while carrying strong with puck, causing coverage problems while keeps moving before passing or shooting. Displays a hard point shot, solid set-ups and smart offensive vision and activation. I am sure there are negatives we can cobble from his defensive end work, but is difficult to not be excited at the the prospect’s playmaking and scoring abilities. The cherry on top the cake is he is more than willing to drop the gloves and has a strong right hand too. Did I say he is still playing in Russia?"
0,2019,Colten Ellis,"Technically sound goaler who plays calm and collected and excellent flexibility. Smooth handles his movements up and down and sideways with control. Absorbs shots, and re-sets quickly. Rebound control and redirection is a work in progress. Thrives on being the man in big games. His behind the puck handling is an area he will work to improve on."
0,2019,Simon Holmström,"So far he has had an injury-riddle past that probably has set him back in his development. Projects as a two-way winger capable of sliding over and playing some centre. High on ice IQ, reading the situations and reacting in all three zones. Displays a high skill level and creativity and does so many things well with really good jump with or without the biscuit. Plays in all situations and is counted on at the games end to help hold the lead. Breaks up attacks and quickly initiates the transition counter strikes. Will take possession and go end to end, beat a defender wide and drop the leg to split the defenders into the middle. Hasn’t shown he is an overly physical player, but that may be due to his post injury anxieties. This youngster will get plenty of scrutiny and might surprise by going off the draft board a whole lot earlier than expected."
0,2019,Ryan Johnson,"Lightweight mobile new age attacking defenseman with good upside due to his mobility, puck carrying skills and over all awareness. Excellent in transition with the outlet pass or my carrying the mail. His high end footwork allows him to be aggressive defensively with the confidence in his lateral agility to get back in the mix. In the World Junior Challenge, he acted as a shadow who mirrored the movements of Podkolzin. Needs to get better in his diagnosis and reaction in his end so he isn’t running around so much, but his feet with eventually settle down and slow the game down. Very good at joining the rush down low, but is careful not to get caught. His long fast strides point to his upside. Almost looks as though he uses the boards to secure the time and space to suddenly explode out at top gear in a series of cuts to surprise and catch teams flat footed. There is lots of upside in this youngster who needs a bit more development and weight room work."
0,2019,Oleg Zaitsev,"Big import Centre-wing with good size and powerful stride who plays strong on the puck. A very good small area passer and is committed to a 200 foot game player with really excellent North-South quickness. Very skilled with good anticipation, and good offensive instincts. He has been able to slide up and down the Red Deer lines and fill in all on-ice roles and situation on the PP or PK. He tracks loose pucks and can carry them and separate himself from the opposition's traffic. Can and will take shots, but is more of a playmaker and although not an excellent lateral player, he displays good edging and reads plays well as a defender and is an agile attacker. Is strong in his arms and was a essential player in the top six while playing for Dynamo as has continued to be for Red Deer."
0,2019,Matvey Guskov,"A premium import addition who was thought to be a first rounder after the scouts got their looks in London, after all he is surrounded by a strong club that plays all styles."
0,2019,Pavel Dorofeyev,"Intriguing long term prospect who still needs to get stronger fill out his big frame and continue to development his game. Displays good hands, net drive, and good defensive presence in his overall play. Lacks first step explosion but he is still developing. This skilled winger is a big riser and the team selecting him will be patiently wait for his payoff."
0,2019,Jordan Spence,"Fits the push defender style well with his high end tools, mobility and power play quarterbacking prowess. Not completely polished in his own end, he is good without the puck and a smart hockey head in his own zone. Really good puck carrier with vision. Very agile and mobile but still needs to improve and get stronger if he is to progress to the highest level play. Lots to like in this development push defender."
0,2019,NIck Robertson,"Lil Centre / wing with excellent feel for the puck, the eyes and quick on-ice reading of the action who starred in the CHL Prospects game setting up plays and flying each and every shift. Displays elite skills with the biscuit and can and will outmuscle the big boys for the puck. Has a deceptive fast release, and excellent accuracy. So good at surprising the opposition with rocketing passes of his stick, pivoting off the wall and placing pucks on his linemates tape for goals. Missed almost a third of the season but returned with a 27 points in 26 game pace. Relentless in puck pursuit. EVERY NHL team has room for this type of player, it is simply a matter of where one will call his name."
0,2019,Jackson LaCombe,"An intriguing high school who has made the transition for being a forward to a rushing defenseman. After a growth spurt, he has now good size, wheels and offensive instincts that helped him amass 20 goals and 81 points in his 50 game season in his sophomore year of high school. A terrific skater with great stop/starts, good edge work, with good vision and up-ice mobility. A power play quarterback who reads and creates in all phases of the attack. His lack of experience at his position seems a mute point as he he shows solid understanding of defensive zone positioning and his responsibilities as a defender. Committed to the University of Minnesota, where he will continue his development."
0,2019,Adam Beckman,"Rising Surprising dub forward who had cracked the second tier of Western League forwards because this unknown rookie has raised hi game and compete level to where he is on the radar. Comes to the after being an elite scorer with and winning the Saskatoon Frostbite midget scoring title with Battlefords Stars prior. This centre-left wing has a strong game when he doesn’t have the puck too. Displays quickness, agility and glide  to his slide scoring 32 goals and 62 points in 68 games and is was having strong play playoff production."
0,2019,Mikko Kokkonen,"An under six foot defender who is almost 200 pounds but is regarded as yet another new age attacking defenders, despite the fact he excels prominently at neutralizing the opposing teams better attackers. Has all the attributes of the prototypical modern defenseman in his good feet, ability to skate pucks out of trouble with no panic. Displays good feet and light edging that aids in high transition skills. His own forwards count on his ability to successful initiate the breakouts. He will go into a tight spin elude forecheckers, confidently carry the puck using his big first step and make outlet passes with force. He will use his short bursts to secure loose pucks and navigate through traffic safely. He isn’t a gambler offensively and capitalizes only if the situations allow him to. His edging aids his work as a power play quarterback who distributes well on zone entires and while walking the blue line."
0,2019,Isaiah Saville,"Odd Duck right shooting goalie is a winner who is a terrific athlete with superb reflexes who already stops second and third attempts with a cool and calm demeanor far past his age. Displays excellent puck tracking, super quick leg pads and the ability to direct rebounds where he wants them. Fills the net and there is little net to shoot at. All he has done in the 2018-19 season is play for the U.S. Junior Select Team in the World Junior A Challenge, where he posted a shutout in the gold-medal game victory, lead the USHL in goals against average in this his rookie season. A tremendous skater with or with his equipment on, he is rising up the charts. He is committed to the University of Nebraska-Omaha."
0,2019,Kaedan Korczak,"The amazing Kelowna defenseman factory seems to continue to crank out solid NHL candidates and seems like yet another in KK, who plays a smart positioned offensive game with his precision passing and opportune slides to open areas. Handles the puck well on his receptions and has good knee-bend, so he pivots with power in transition or after he provides a secondary outlet for his teams puck carrier out of their defensive zone.  Very good in his end and handles business inside the box area, and is very cognizant when he has to move to another man in his defensive assignment. Although not looked as a power play primary QB, he has a good half wind-upshot, and is excellent at disguising a pass with a slap pass shot to a teammate on the doorstep. Has nice size and upside."
0,2019,Brayden Tracey,"Solidly built winger who is confident in his carries in the high traffic, and had a 36 goal 81 point season. He is not the finished product and he needs to become a higher pace 60 minute player. Light on his skates and edges, he finds the soft areas and is opportunistic in tracking down rebounds, like he was built to be a greasy area scorer. His rookie WHL season is one where he has excelled with no fear failure. Will need time to round out is development, but clearly his name has been rising on draft boards."
0,2019,Jamieson Rees,"Rocketing up the draft charts after missing the initial two months to a lacerated kidney, this undersized fireball has first step quickness, and will open up his stride make moves that launch him past defenders, popping off his edges or will stutter step, and get the goaler to commit and drop to make more open net high. A two-way player who never stops working at both ends, and is also able to caress the puck while in ascending to top speed in pass receptions or while he is splitting the defenders. Dynamic under-sided junior player that could see time at pivot. Reads coverage/positioning and capitalizes where the entrance points are and finds the seams to open ice, gets to the nest and for rebounds. At top speed can feather the puck to teammates. Has a quick snap shot. Relentless two way forward who will work hard to get the puck back."
0,2019,Patrik Puistola,"An eye-opening performance at the Ivan Hlinka Tourney, where he dominated in matches. A lean six footer, he most certainly seemed to have a high level of functional strength and blazing speed that aided him in dominating battles all over the sheet. Not the most gifted high end skill player, he nonetheless give great energy and created lots of scoring opportunities by carrying defenders on his back to the net, winning most board battles and thrown big hits, and driving hard to the net strong on the puck. His wide stance enabled his quick pivots to receive passes and loose pucks and drive hard on the attack. Pounces on turnovers and capitalizes. Saw little time with his top end teammates, which left me wondering what if he was surrounded by quality line mates. Worth a look."
0,2019,Maxim Cajkovic,"Slovakian wing who is in first North American season in the QMJHL after an excellent season in Sweden's J20 Superelite with Malmo and then following it up with an eye-opening World Junior Under-17. A very agile East-West skater who has excellent jump and a very good shot. his actually skaing is average, and there may be a lack of hockey s=marts and vision, but the ability to shoot is his strength. This season with a weaker St. John team he struggled but still managed 22 goals / 46 points in 60 games, but he also was sat out when he looked like he was give less than the best when teams rolled up scores on his putrid team. I think there is enough there for some team to take a chance that there is a player they can develop."
0,2019,John Beecher,"Elmira-New York native with excellent size, physicality, competitiveness and good jump and feet. A North-South skater who can get wide and go to the net or be a heavy rugged force in the high traffic areas, along the wall, and in the cycle. Besides being a handful for opposing defenseman, he has good hands as a scoring threat. He will a player who sets up between the circles near the blue paint and puts rebounds in the back of the net. A big centre who may project to wing has a really nice stride, first step quickness, and a smattering of skill.  Refinement of his defensive zone commitment is in order, but you can'y overlook his pro caliber release, or how well he  protects the puck. Committed to the University of Michigan."
0,2019,Alex Beaucage,"Has become a nice sized winger with his growth spurt and with it he has grown into a nice prospect flows with the games tempo all 200 feet. Quickly gets to open ice and displays light edging and makes himself available for receptions, and can gain inside position and cut hard to the net. Blocks shots. Has room to put more weight on his frame and he can get quicker as get comfortable with his taller / larger size. A finisher who was third on his team in scoring with 39 Goals, 79 Assist in 68 games. Handles the puck well at top gear and reads the ice well, usually anticipating a step ahead of the play. A longer term developmental guy whose needle is pointing upward."
0,2019,Samuel Bolduc,"Finished his second full season in the Q, and this big man has improved his stock.His positive play against his CHL draft peers in the Prospect game helped too. Displays good puck control and can even one hand it to get some room to move out in transition. Protects the biscuitwvery well. Does so many little things well already. Gets open as an outlet for his forwards, dominates the wall play and  his aggressive demeanor on the boards and in front of his net, wins pucks and makes impressions. He has a good feel for where and when to pinch in the offense zone, and opens up his stance to let it rip from the blue line too. Very strong physical guy who will match up well as his career continues, because he knocks players off their feet."
0,2019,Lassi Thomson,"Kelowna defenseman factory part one: this Finnish import acclimated to the smaller ice surface quickly and plays a style which dictates his gaining the offensive zone. A mobile defender whose polishing his passing and zone entries in hopes of progressing to the NHL as an eventual power play Quarterback. Has displayed fearless in the defensive end, willing to block shots, or step up in the opposition as they try and gain ice.  Very aware of his positioning in his end or when he adjust into open ice going the other way. Always moving his feet and has a good short area burst to get to loose biscuits, and his stickhandling allows him room in traffic. Displays an excellent stick to break up passes, and although his creativity is just emerging, he is very good at laying precision passes on his moving in down deep in the attack zone. And his shot from the point is already coming at NHL velocity. A bit of a riverboat gambler. Still developing but may be second round consolation prize. Cool and collected and improving nicely."
0,2019,Nils Höglander,"In the Four Nations Tourney, this agile whirling dervish was the bright star of a dimly lit Swedish contingent. Short and well built, he shakes off defenders and is near the puck a whole lot. Undersized wingers must contend with upward battles of consistency and confidence as they try to crave a space out in the higher levels of the game. This 185 pounder will be faced with an uphill climb but it might be early to start throwing in the towel on his chances. Very confident in his puck-handling, he is quite adept at making tough passes, and traveling the sheet at top speed and tight edging and quick stop/starts that help create separation from defenders, and attacks the weak spots in coverage. Shortens his stick even more to navigate through the highest spaces. Looked very good as a component of  Sweden’s U20 team, but his graduation to the SHL has not been an easy one partially because his Rögle club isn’t an awfully good one that surrounds him with complimentary linemates who can strengthen his game. He has a surprising one timer, and is nimble enough to drive through closed lanes and get scoring looks. I am sure he hasn’t given up and become unconfident in his abilities, but he had a very poor first season, yielding only seven goals and seven assists. He might be more of a set up man than scorer."
0,2019,Nolan Foote,"Adan Foote's second son is a big strong forward who advances the puck well and has a strong, heavy wrist shot. Very smart player whose strong on his stick and cerebral in his positioning and thinking. Constantly in motion and he leans into his blades and displays crisp edging and can lead entires with excellent passes and once in the attack zone can make nice saucer dishes to open teammates. His changes of direction are abrupt and he looks like a prospect that checks all the boxe at wing."
0,2019,Artemi Kniazev,"Strong two-defender in the mix as a first rounder. Not overly big, but very willing to play aggressive in both ends. Creative in the attack zone and will step up at his blue line to make contact will maintain good gaps or be more than willing to engage on the wall. Has a low hard shot and has good intelligence and creativity in the offensive end. sees the situation and can be a deceptive creator with great passes and slap passes that are unsuspecting. Will carry the mail or make the outlet."
0,2019,Harrison Blaisdell,"Well-condtionred warrior who looked impressive during the World Junior Challenge. Although he is under six foot, he plays big and displays excellent ""wide"" speed that helps him stay around the pucks where loose or ready to be loosened in the middle and attack zones. Will jump into small enemy breakdowns and advance them in transition. Opportunistic around the crease winnin g rebounds and putting them in the back of the net. A high tempo attacker that can swoop from outside to middle open lanes before you know he has re-positioned. Knocks defenders off pucks drives past checks and also takes away many pucks."
0,2019,Yegor Afanasyev,"Projects as a future power wing with good offense tools, soft hands, who had climbing production numbers, and looks to improve on them further. He will need to fill out get stronger and fix the hitch in his skating, improve his first couple steps. Displays a pro level shot / release.He is committed to Michigan State University where he is eventually improve on his all-around game. Impressive combination of size, skill, power and hockey smarts. Until he was injured, he was clear the best player in the USHL Showcase. He will be a good value selection as a developmental player who could help down the pike."
0,2019,Jakob Pelletier,"High-pace undersized wing who who displays a high hockey I Q, speed, quickness and a high-level of competitiveness. This is yet another case of a  yet another smaller lightweight who projects to continuing being able to play hard in 200 feet of rink, without the benefit of high end fictional strength, and displaying a great all around skill package. He finishes plays, make things happen on the forecheck and looks even better when paired with high skilled line mates he can read off of. Good accurate shooter and 60 minute motor."
0,2019,Brett Leason,"This third year eligible player has made himself relevant as a possible first round choice by adding at least 50 more points than he produce the season before. Point totals don't dictate draft hierarchy, but his World Junior Under-20 performance cannot be ignored. Sure, he needs to get faster add a quicker burst in the first step, which will help him to loose pucks, but he has super-soft hands, really excellent vision and a big strong shot. He is a big physical specimen that plays with physicality down low, and has the agility to shake loose, pivot and get shots off with defenders cemented to him. He has East-west elusiveness, and when he gets moving, he is difficult to derail. Display excellent vision and a hard heavy shot that he delivers in stride. Has gone from a long shot to a name that will be called in June."
0,2019,Ville Heinola,"An undersized Finnish defender already playing in the Finnish elite league. A very effective offensive man who will benefit from more strength and development, but no denying his edgework and ability to move up-ice fluidly and at a rapid pace.  Was injured at the World Junior for a substantial time, but returned to display high end skill and feet. In the World Junior U-20, he was a smart positional player, reading what was developing on the ice, moving the biscuit quickly or carrying it confidently deep into the attack zone. Displays good vision, agility and anticipation."
0,2019,Alex Vlasic,"Chicago-area defensive prospect with fluid feet and lots of size already. Still raw, but quickly advancing as an all-around force on the backline. This a tall USA defender with an excellent overall skill package. Has a high panic threshold and stays cool under pressure, never scrambling and throwing pucks away. A sharp outlet passer in transition and when in the attack zone, he reads the attack well and uses his strong wrists to deliver precise on the stick passes. takes away centre ice and closes his gaps well in the back pedal. Closes off passing lanes and reacts to what is happening in the moment. will break out in transition and make good decisioned outlets, and occasional home-run pass, but isn't looked at as a future NHL mailman as an attacker. Is good offensively from the blue line and makes plays back there. Committed to Boston College."
0,2019,Tobias Björnfot,"A push the pace attacking defenseman who plays with some jam, and a blazing wrist shot. A mobile defender who pivots well, he has a bit more size and thickness than many of the prospects categorized as  new age push the pace defenseman. Plays calm and aware ib is end and is willing to engage with attackers trying to set up shop in front. At the U-18 Five Nations tourney in the summer, he tied the game for Sweden against the United States in the final period and then with an end to end rush, he tiede it again."
0,2019,Nathan Légaré,"Legare is 200 plus pound winger with strong core muscle and knee bend that allows a low to the ice center stride and a punishing contact heaviness to his game. His over all skating has continued to improve and he is difficult to contain in the heavy traffic areas. Not timid in his physicality. Will be 40 plus goal scorer and shows improving set up skills to coincide with his ability to finish. Has good anticipation, and will hit his teammates with deceptive precise feeds on the attack. Is anxious to make a difference on the offensive side, so you might see him anxious to get back on the attack, but he is good at reading the opposition and stepping up and taking away passes. Getting noticed more and more as the season continues."
0,2019,Spencer Knight,"It is very rare that NHL teams select and strike gold with 18 year old goaltending prospects in the top 50 selections, because the cultivation process and certainty of accurate evaluations are based on potential that may take a half dozen years to develop into true top-flight NHLers whereas the chaaces with forward selections are much ""safer."""
0,2019,Phillip Tomasino,"High tempoed terrific skater who unearths his share of pucks with aggressive pursuit speed quickness and light edging that allows him to a superior forechecker. Displays a quick snap shot, good hands in small spaces and good stick control on his backhand. He is light and undersized at this juncture but is good foot speed is a high IQed two way centre with excellent hand and the ability to score. Needs to work on his away from the puck game. His rise is a key part to the Ice Dogs rise as a team. His deficit is he really doesn't have a top gear, and needs to gain strength."
0,2019,Connor McMichael,"Centre-wing with excellent speed, hands, shot and instincts. His high end creativity and vision are what is helping him succeed and a sniper. Had 30+ goals  as February began. Very patient and instinctive, and his puck control (due to his soft hands) have in control in the attack zone. Not a finished product as he needs to improve in his recognition and coverage in the the other two zones, and one would hope he continues to improve in his involvement in the high traffic areas. Has seem duty on wing and centre, and needs plentyb of work to improve in the faceoff circle. Average sized at this point, and London has done a nice job patiently bringing him along. His defensive game needs more fine-tuning, but he has lots of attributes that will see him coming off the draft board fairly early."
0,2019,Bobby Brink,"Hard working undersized winger with excellent feet, hands and goal scoring ability. Makes offense easy with his high hockey IQ, creativity, quickness and great hands that send precision attempts on the net. Was awarded the MVP of the World Junior A Challenge 2018 tournament. Displays a deadly one timer. Easily finds the opposite side winger with his cross ice feed."
0,2019,Ryan Suzuki,"Smart quick scoring centre who gets loose and can shoot the puck. Displays a quick release and strong shot that he can get off in traffic with accuracy. Thinks the game fast but plays under control and can patiently slow things down, drawing defenders towards him, and using his calm stick to locate and hit his teammates crisply or with beautiful feathers despite the traffic. He plays with a very long stick but keeps pucks in close. A three zone player who plays smart and isn't wasting effort but letting things develop. Doesn't look like a guy who is going to going to attempt to play too physical; he will beat you by suddenly bursting and disrupting with an interception, break-up or a no long pass to a teammate. He does tend to stay out of the dirty areas concentrating on using his feet, hands, and imagination at even strength the penalty-kill or the power play. Has excellent hands and good creativity and vision, but needs more ice time to develop fully."
0,2019,Samuel Poulin,"Patrick's son already has one strong rookie season in the Q under his belt and looks to build on his 45 point season of last although injures have slowed him to a point per game pace. This kid is a power forward in the making with a strong first step, power moves while in the attack zone, and creating space in the dirty areas because the word on his chippiness got out. Always moving, sidestepping and showing excellent feet in navigating the attack zone and unearthing loose pucks. Protects the puck with his bigger frame and he uses his skating  and edging to power into full speed cuts. Has fast feet, fast head and plays fast. It hard for me to imagine he wont come off the draft board before the last third of the first round. Sometimes your bloodline gets your name called quickly."
0,2019,Vladislav Kolyachonok,"Yet another Flint team player who despite the weak roster, simply gives his best shift in, shift out with high end four direction skating a creative offensive abilities. A dynamic four direction skater who possesses natural flair with his offense instincts. His feet let him stay with attackers and he can open up to become a force in the attack zone when he chooses to not hold back as he did in the CHL prospects game. He still needs to progress to where his defensive awareness is instinctual, but he breaks up plays and quickly sends pucks out of his end with hard outlets. With Flint, he was a constant Flyer up ice"
0,2019,Matthew Robertson,"Tall right side defender with a muscular frame, strong skating burst, and cannon of a shot. Is capable of being the the guy who carries on the attack zone entires, a PP QB. A good skater who can give a little space on attackers and the then close it down, or if they try to burst through, move laterally shadowing them. Has a powerful shooting precense from the point displaying a strong hard shot. Is very good with his stick to place pucks on teammates sticks, because he has strong wrists and doesn’t need momentum to deliver the puck.Extremely poised in every zone and uses his reach and stick to take away and advance pucks on the attack. Nimble, smart and although not viewed as a attacking quick up offenseman, it is difficult to dismiss how well he plays when the puck is near him. Looks like a first rounder."
0,2019,Moritz Seider,"Huge German defender with a strong two way game and a willingness to take the body whenever the opportunity occurs. Will get stronger and is still growing into his frame. Cemented his status as a possible first rounder after his performance in the B-pool of the World Junior U-20. A defender who can play big minutes shoulder the responsibilities in all phases, due to his maturity. Displays a strong  under control game with strong hockey smarts. Not a burner or offenseman type, but makes the transition outlet pass and is comfortable carrying the mail out of his end. Has a strong accurate shot. At this juncture, he might not look like a first pair NHL defender offensively or a first pair PP QB, but there is plenty here to like, and good be a value sleeper taken mid-first round"
0,2019,Cam York,"Reliable all-around mobile defenseman who needs to add weight and muscle on his thin frame. Isn't going to knock attackers down, but with use his high end skating, head and elite stick-handling to beat you the other way. Very mobile and agile whose footwork can re-position him away from shot blockers and checkers. High IQ and high pace flyer with impressive feet and stick. Lacks size but that is becoming less of an issue if the defenseman can push the pace, pass the puck and get back in his end in a hurray. His shot needs some strength but  he still projects as a future power play QB, he was one of the better US players in the World Junior U-18s. Committed to the University of Michigan."
0,2019,Victor Söderström,"An under six foot Swedish defender with terrific speed, balance and stick and already has a two-way game. And that game is not in Swedish junior, it is in the SHL pro league, so these critics who try and pick apart and elevate prospects who have only seen play against junior are fluffing others at his expense. I continue to read about how he doesn't project to a first pair defender, and to me are mute, when they same critic decides another junior player ""projects as a NHL first pair guy, and they there only basis is their junior resumes. This is an under-six foot Swedish defender with terrific speed, balance and stick and already has a two-way game and logs big minutes in the SHL. New age defender who displays high mobility and feet that don’t stop churning. His skating stride is built upon really deep knee bends that place him in a very low close to the ice skating stance. Can jump off on his edges if he’s a way through or to the puck. His hands may get a bit softer, but presently awfully good at controlling pucks when sending them away or when receiving them. Walks the blue line to the open soft spot when on the PP point. May challenge all Swedish defenseman for the bragging rights as best eligible defender. And he certainly doesn't the brush back on his upside at this juncture."
0,2019,Thomas Harley,"Tall OHL left defender who plays on Mississauga’s top pairing. Is a balanced four-direction skater with upright skating style which doesn’t detract him from being and excellent backward skater or his ability to close on attackers. Sees time on the penalty-kill but the PP is where he is an offensive standout, and relishes joining the rush and being a QB. Still working on not getting caught flat-footed in transition, displaying better gap control, and reading the defensive coverages in his end, and some might question whether he has displayed high end attack skills or can play in the higher levels and have success in both ends that he has achieved in junior as he is finesse-type player; what is certain is that he currently already displays sharps edging, quick pivots, vision, excellent offemsive hockey sense, and calm composure taking care of business in his current level with solid passing skills and excellent vision."
0,2019,Arthur Kaliyev,"Lit up the OHL Hamilton championship team, with 31 goals in his rookie season. Part of the Has Duel citizenship  as a Russian American, he was arguably the best player on the USA team at the Ivan Hlinka. A pure sniper and effortless skater floating on his edges, looking nonchalant as the game comes to him. Sees the developing looks and circles to soft areas looking for the puck. He can pick a corner, or be on a rebound quickly. He has decided to dismiss the knock that he isn't willing to play hard in his own end and dispel the criticisms that he should be hustling more in all phases. There is lots their to unlock."
0,2019,Alexander Newhook,"Savvy scorer with exceptional foot speed, elite diaganostic ability, and is constantly driving up ice and has a good shot, great passing abilities and a high hockey IQ.  Smart quick undersized wing who is very strong, deceptive, has tremendously fast stick handling ability and a tenacious 200 foot stick-to-it-ness that makes him a constant threat to score. He has both a power and speed game that brings fans to the edge of their seats. A tenacious forechecker who extends zone time for his team by not letting the defending team room to get out. Bursts in and by defenders and makes moves at top speed and isn’t deterred in small areas avoiding poke checks and blowing by defenders and then even placing himself on a route towards the next one, only to reach around coverage and continue the attack. He makes the tough plays look easy. He isn’t a shrinking violet in the other two zones either, where he providers backside pressure and uses his speed to get back pucks.Really strong and can use his strength to take charge too. Committed to Boston College."
0,2019,Trevor Zegras,"Creative centre who plays an aggressive style at a high skill level with a nice shot release. Was asked to shoulder the top line centre position with the Hughes injury. He already has seen time on left wing on the top line. Possessed top end awareness and vision and has to be also regarded as one of the elite passers in the class, and his anticipation in setting offensive looks is a thing of beauty. In spite of the depth at the centre position, don't be surprised if his name is called earlier than the mocks rank him. He displays many of the same type characteristics that Elias Pettersson, being able to slip in receive and pass the puck to the open man with true quickness and accuracy."
0,2019,Bowen Byram,"All situation new age defender who can control the pace and tempo . Has high IQ for understanding the nuances of his position and executes them in a tough fashion. Has good top speed, stick and passing ability so he never is hesitating coming out of his end and continuing to lead the attack down deep in the attack zone. His strong backward skating ability lets him transition into his back pedal and stop/start in his gaps if he wants to stand an attacker up, and he is able to shadow attackers step for step. I keep reading that he is most certainly a notch ahead of last years Boqvist, Bouchard & Dobson, based on his tool box of skills. I question if he actually is their equal in terms of hockey IQ and on ice recognition, because those strengths are what allow these players to actually play to their strengths. Regardless, a team is going to get a nice chance at a top pair power play QB and maybe a top four defender at the low end of expectations. The question is whether his skating ability helps cover up his lack of defensive recognition."
0,2019,Philip Broberg,"Big, mobile Swedish defender who does everything at a high level. Smart, offensive, and physical on defense, he checks all the boxes as a future NHL'er who can play the fast pace and make plays in his end due to his world class skating ability. NHL team scouts that are down grading him are doing so based him not seeing big minutes with his new AIK team, as a new young buck in the pecking order, but there are definite signs of creativity on the offensive side. The same was true as the youngest defender on the Swedish World Junior U-20 team. Granted he showed chinks in his game with over-handles and longer than necessary possessions, and late read/reacts but I would warn NHL teams from dismissing his size and - skill ratios that allows him to explode on his edges and close in all directions, snuffing zone entries, funneling speedy opposing attackers, driving step for step with them, and sometimes showing a bit of edge in contact. One can imagine him being an even more consistent defensive force who finishes checks and strips pucks even more robustly. This lad gets the nuances of his position and might be one of the fastest backward burst skaters at his position. Never stops moving, has the stretch pass down, and a strong heavy low point shot, and the eagerness to apply offensive pressure down low. I see great value selecting him in the top tier of the first round, not later."
0,2019,Vasily Podkolzin,"Dynamic up and winger who can make a difference in every game he plays with his and ability to play a power game, get in tight, barreling through opponents to make plays. Lines up at the half wall from the right side and uses his left shot to fire blasts on the PP. Smart and always in motion, looking to have the puck returned to his possession. He captained the Russian Hlinka Tourney team by example. In the Bronze metal game, while on the PK, he worked the wall in his end to unearth a puck which he quickly got up ice giving his teammate a breakaway. His teammates attempt was stopped and as the USA team tried to exit their defensive end, he meets the exiting US player with contact, and the puck rolls to his teammate at the red line who advances it to him. he enters the zone near the left wall and as the US defender closes, he spins back around and fires a backhand pass to his teammate who got another chance. Always working, and has such quick hands and head. The year the Blues stole Tarasenko 16th overall, I commented in my mock (where I had Tarasenko ""a gift dropping to slot ten"", due to the ""Russian factor"") how this was a top five guy."
0,2019,Alex Turcotte,"Alfie's son is a 200 foot centre with decent size and elite feet and hands. His wide skating base and strong edging work allows him rapid change in direction. Unfazed by venturing into the dirty battle areas. He can finish and his puck-handling, high hockey instincts, and soft hands rate up near the top of the class. An injury-riddled year has set him back a bit, but I wouldn’t count him out of being taken in the early part of the first round. Has great speed, an extra gear and displays strong edging. Has really good patience in his possessions, and will rile defenses into over commitment, nd then place the biscuit on a teammates stick for a shot. He will fearlessly take a hit, kills penalties, block shots and more importantly is an improving in the dot. Has built a two-way game. High end skill, balance, explosive feet and terrific touch may be enough to land NHL suitors who think the end product is going to something special. Has seen action as a winger. Committed to the University of Wisconsin."
0,2019,Kirby Dach,"Got an early taste in the ""Dub"" when injuries befell the forwards on Saksatoon, and showed off his competitive nature and was able to set up and score goals as a 16 year old, and displays smarts, size, good feet and a 200 foot commitment. Not a speedster, but has a great stick and soft hands as a high-end playmaker. Can control the pace and the play. Another wing-centre who is very strong on his skates and can move with above average speed while he maintains possession using his soft hands to find open line mates when he has the puck, and quickly ghost into quiet soft areas to receive returns and scoring looks. When watching a guy this big, you think he is going to get held up but he seems to keep driving effortless keeping the defenders away from the puck with his long reach and staying in motion while he supports the play. He avoids attackers with side-stepping and a quick stick. He follows the action but the action tends to follow him too. Strong in so many phases of the game already, he is always close to attackers in his end nudging close deterring their advance. Is a regular of the PK and PP. I think there is upside as a pro scorer, but many of his goals will continue to come with plays he started where he positioned himself between the circles, stick on the ice, and wasn’t stopped. He is able to read coverages, make sharp cuts, by driving into the turns. His edge work keeps him away from closing traffic, and frequently leaving him uncovered in the dirty areas. Plenty of room to imagine him as blossoming as a scorer as well as set-up guy. May project as an NHL centre. Big guy with big strong wrists, who gets in close and difficult to move out from the front or take the puck away from. It might take time but no NHL team is going to pass on big man with these tools."
0,2019,Jack Hughes,"Orlando Florida born who many are calling the next Patrick Kane. His parents both played the game and his father is an ex-Bruins coach and minor pro coach, whose originally from the Mississauga area. The top line centre in the US program who gets thinks done with strong hands, terrific vision and quick feet. Great anticipation and the ability to hold pucks on his stick no matter where he ventures. He steers pucks through traffic and his terrific vision and edging simply get opponents scrambling and unsure where the play is going to open into a solid look. He can come to a dead stop, and watch a crowd converge on his space, and wire a puck to the open spot of net. Has a terrific shot when he uses it too. Some think he is always willing to attempt inside moves, refusing to get funneled to the periphery and his gambling style might be seen as too abrasive. May project to wing, but we like him as a smaller pivot at this juncture, because he is such a dynamic, fast paced player despite not being the big strong powerful centre teams look for."
0,2019,Dylan Cozens,"Difference making power centre-wing with great wheels, powerful wide base and stride, motor, powerful shot and ability to use his hands to quickly take possessions and make plays. A big power player who will play in traffic every shift and do with some nasty. His veracity in puck battles along the boards makes it necessary to “double cover’ him. World class skater who is very strong on his skates and shows added explosion on the attack, while being able to pass the biscuit with precision and touch. Point per game WHL rookie last season who is committed as a 200 foot player armed with deadly shot selections. This man child isn't through filling in or building his muscle. Makes everyone around him better. Will cause problems in front, or from the perimeters. Exploits the defense and reads linemates well. Fluid non-stop player who plays hockey smart and would fly through a wall to help his team win. Can project as a big centre as well as a big wing. The sky’s the limit."
0,2019,Mack Guzda,"Prototypical big goaltender whose long legs, along with strong four direction movements, has a superb push and slide side to side, a strong mental attitude, and good glove and blocker. Once planted, he is able to thrust to his destination and replant bringing his lateral movement to a abrupt halt. His long torso closes off much of the top part of the net. Always keeps his glove up toward the puck carrier. Has had some issues with clears where he has had miscommunications with his defenseman and clears go awry."
0,2019,Matthew Boldy,"WInger with a solid two-way game, who finds the soft spots in coverage, and has plenty of skill and good feet. He is well-balance flyer who can circumnavigate through tight spaces at high speeds and his high level puck skills including super soft hands that let him keep opposing defenders guessing on how they should react. Has nice size, displays a strong wrister, and plays a style that fits so well with the new attacking schemes. Really high end hockey sense, and full throttle involved player whose on-ice presence seems to tip the scales in his team's favor when he is out on the sheet, no matter if it is in open ice, or in tight stick cluttered scenery. Reads, reacts and anticipates and answers with precision through traffic passes and receptions while playing with a cool demeanor. What becomes clear with views of him is that he is continually in scoring position and able to provide a threat whenever his line gets a foothold in the attack zone. Very defensively responsible and fills the uncovered attackers when breakdowns occur. Did I mention his heavy shot and quick release? Committed to Boston College."
0,2019,Raphaël Lavoie,"There are diverse opinions on how quickly this huge winger goes off the draft board because he is so dominating against the smaller QMJHL players he regularly plays against. There is no denying he seduces your opinion with his long reach and sneaky deceptive release of the puck that catches goalies off guard. Was added to the World Junior Summer Showcase as an injury replacement and played well when surrounded by really good teammates. At this juncture, he projects more as a right wing, and not a centre. He will have to radically improve his acceleration, foot speed, and pace to be thought capable of patrolling centre ice in higher levels."
0,2019,Kaapo Kakko,"Big Finnish man child with above average size, speed/skill sets. Although is still in need of weight room strength, in both the upper and lower body, he already thinks and advances the puck at a high level and fearlessly drive the front. Moves and stick-handles at top speed, and displays an excellent snap shot. A big kid who maintains possession with his strong hands / stick strength. Strong North-South skater with excellent burst, agility and hockey vision. Can project as a future NHL centre for some clubs seeking a big pivot, but is a perfect fit as a big fast scoring option who plays with a solid playmaking NHL centre."
0,2019,Cole Caufield,"Right now, a diminutive score with great wheels, passing hands, a feisty side and an incredible goal scoring ability. Hides his release point and shows great velocity and needs very little time or space to shoot and score. He plays heavy on his stick and display a wicked backhand, a quick wrister and devastating one-timers. Has a shake and bake weight shift and use of his edges that allows for surprising shots when they are least expected.  The Wisconsin native is committed to the University of Wisconsin, and size is NOT a concern."
207,2015,Jeremiah Addison,"Skilled wing with a strong skating style who is good one-on-one when carrying, and finds soft areas when he doesn't have it. Good release. Good forechecker with good physicality."
0,2019,Peyton Krebs,"Spirited competitor with skill and competitiveness. He was the top pick in the Bantam draft. Dynamic game changing centre-forward with above average skills in all areas and a player who leads by example. Despite not being a big man, he plays a high energy, no shift off game. Has a strong defense zone presence, and battles hard in all three zone. Excellent skater with a long stride, who uses his edges and body to separate himself and not hemmed in, always has enough room to find his teammates or pick a corner with a hard snapper. Displays terrific vision and feel on the attack. Very good face off man, and one of the best in junior at making the right decision of whether to shoot or to pass on every given play. Can no look pass with the best of them. Can play both positions as he ascends to higher levels. A true on ice leader who gives it all shift after shift."
210,2015,Tate Olson,"Sleepr whose development might have flown under the radar a bit. He has above average height at Six foot, two, but needs to fill out even more. He has displayed a nice skill package and a pretty solid head, vision, and calm to continue improving. Longer term developmental defenseman who is worth taking a look at."
205,2015,Evan Smith,"Six foot six goaltender with long legs and athleticism who blocks much of the open net in the theme re-occurring over and over in the pro game. A knee injury had him off the map for a while, but is now back closing up the bottom and covering the top. Far from a finished product, he needs work on his rebound control and redirecting shots with his pads."
206,2015,Ryan Bednard,"Another USA developmental goalie prospect with long legs and big frame he can grow into. Good athlete, but still very raw and will need lost of time to hone his trade. Committed to Bowling Green University."
204,2015,Jack Sadek,"High School defenseman with powerful legs all direction skating ability and a good burst. His skating balance meshes well his puck handling skills and gives him tools enabling him to either make that first pass or carry the puck out in transition. Doesn’t get rattled and plays with a bit of edge, and jam. Still developing as an offensive player and teams will project him as a long term project who has committed to the University of Minnesota."
203,2015,Matteo Gennaro,Strong skating centre with good size and agility. Is strong on the puck and at times uses his size down low and on the wall. Displays nice mitts and a quick release.The knock is his lack of sustained physicality and game by game intensity and consistency. When things are happening for a player offensively you expect they pick it up in the defensive zone and good things happen. He doesn't seem to buy into the showing up part.
202,2015,Petter Hansson,"Effective two-way defender with good boots,  calm, and attack instincts. Display a good shot, and can carry-stickhandle while at top gear. Solid passer who maked the right pass from the blueline. His mobility aids him in his work in his end, where he wins back pucks and controls the  tempo if his team comes under pressure."
200,2015,Adam Marsh,"A sniper you is carrying under 160 lbs. and has the ability to score from all places on the sheet. Very one dimensional and doesn’t have an all-around game to fall back on if his sniping goes dry. Son of former five year NHL veteran, Peter."
198,2015,Sami Niku,"Poised Finnish defender who excellent foot speed and confident puck-handling ability. Reads the situations quickly and makes consistently solid decisions when in control of the puck. An accurate passer who doesn’t get hurried. Is already strong for a six footer and fends of the forechecker on his attempts out of his end. His combination of good feet speed, balance and strength let him knock much bigger players off the puck. Is decisive in his reads and very patient to make the right play using nice touch on his passes. An up and comer. A member of his homeland’s team roster for the World Junior Under-20 at Christmas 2014."
201,2015,Gustav Bouramman,"Under six foot carrier who has very good puck skills, excellent feet and crisp passing ability. he is not going to engage attackers physically, but use his stick to beat them. His puck handling prowess at top speed and his lateral movement help him make excellent decisions on the attack and in his end. He plays strong with the biscuit and is a PP QB and solid transition player. Has a couple gears. Will need time to develop and get physically stronger and thicker."
195,2015,Jack Becker,He has committed to the University of Wisconsin..
197,2015,Nikita Pavlychev,"Hulking centreman who stands eye to eye with Ben Bishop. He is only a little over 200 pounds so there is plenty of room on his frame to fill out. Has decent feet and puck handling skills and is surprising agile for such a large guy. is really good in his own end. Even with the developmental wait, it seems very likely a NHL team will call his name, and see if he can add the necessary balance quickness and strength to his game. Committed to Penn State."
190,2015,Marcus Vela,"Big centre with offensive instincts, strong feet, a  large bit of edge, and a well-rounded power game. Never give sup on plays, and wins wall battles shift after shift. Has nice understanding of play and good vision. May project to a pro winger. Committed to the University of New Hampshire."
191,2015,Gustav Olhaver,"A giant six and half foot left winger who is a very good skater and competes hard in all areas. It’s rare to find players thus size with strong leg drive and balance. Very tough for other junior players to slow him down. He is tough to match-up against oblong the wall and in the front, where he drives hard and fights for the rebounds. Clearly a player that is now on the radar as a long term developing big man. Nice prospect for a team willing to watch him build on his game and physical stature."
187,2015,Chaz Reddekopp,"Intriguing prospect on the backline with excellent size and physicality. Clear the crease and handles the wall. Loves to throw his weight around and engage attackers. What has to develop is his offensive side. Would rather dish than take shots, and always passes if there is a hint of pressure from the defense. Ends up rushing his shot when he does try and take it. Long term prospect that a team might want to select and bring along  his offensive side slowly."
185,2015,Nikita Korostelev,Russian import in his second year in the OHL. Has displayed a strong offensive game not only in open ice but along the wall.  A strong puck carrier and stickhandler who has already surpassed his goal totals from his rookie year. Despite the fact that he is thin 175 he certainly plays stronger and bigger than his size. His biggest flaw is almost a complete lack of game when he doesn’t have the puck. That might be a matter of learning and maturing into a 200 game. There is no denying his skill set and abilities to undress defender and surprising speed in the attack zone. He has significant upside and projects as a possible first rounder
184,2015,Adam Huska,Adam Huska 204  oct 8
181,2015,Joni Tuulola,"Lanky second year eligible two-way defenseman with a calm demeanor and lots of likable qualities. he was noticeable at the World Junior Under-18, where he made effective plays at both ends. An excellent passer out of his zone and good puck handling ability. Has good feet but needs lower body strength that will make him quicker and more agile. Still an empty canvass in parts of his development but already has a high hockey IQ,plays smart, and just needs to grow his game and body a bit more."
177,2015,Simon Bourque,Averaged sized QMJHL defender who is have displays all around skills and a improving three zone game. Makes good decisions and passes the puck really well. Plays a positionally sound game and has some physicality.
176,2015,Liam Dunda,"Does most things well, but at this juncture his size and competiveness maybe his own developed attributes. Long term developemntal."
173,2015,Colby Williams,"Although still under six foot, he displays a physical game and has some touch on the offensive side."
178,2015,Steven Ruggiero,Big USA program defender that will continue his development as an improved passer and skater with Penn State.
174,2015,Lukas Jasek,A high energy player who can really shoot the puck. Has very good acceleration and fluid stride. Gets to the loose pucks and has good instincts where to go with it.  Long term project who needs to build strength. His puck smarts alone will garnish him consideration.
171,2015,Nicholas Boka,"A Michigan born USA developmental team defender with size and tools. A physical player always willing to battle it out-inside and outside of the whistle. Stands up for teammates. His commitment to the University of Michigan will give him the time to develop his game, as the team that drafts him waits patiently."
167,2015,Frederik Tiffels,Long term developmental propspect from Germany who shows offensive flair with his superb skating and acceleration.
168,2015,Mason Appleton,"Second year eligible who was a disruptive force as a strong forechecker and has added a toolbox with better skills and feet that project him as guy who can slide up and down to various different lines. Needs time, but he is much improved. Committed to Michigan State University."
169,2015,David Cotton,"Big centre-forward with a long reach and excellent skills and head for the game on the entire sheet. Good in the dot and uses his vision to make crisp passes. Has a higher upside than most in terms of O, but before in my top five rounds I would like to see a sample in a higher competition level. He committed to Boston College where we will see just that next season. Some NHL club may not wait."
164,2015,Roy Radke,"Geneva Illinois born big-wing whose development is hampered by lack of foot speed, acceleration in stop/starts. Relishes using his body to play aggressively, and back checks hard, but his puck skills and offensive output need plenty of time."
165,2015,Cameron Hughes,Long term centre prospect who has play seems to have hit a wall at Wisconsin where he has had to play against older developed opponents. His poor results has lead to him losing ice time and he now needs to catch up in practice and the weight room.
160,2015,Adam Parsells,"Mammoth US born defender with a good hockey IQ an active stick and a wingspan of an airplane. He has great balance and four direction mobility for a growing teenager and is calm and confident going into his zone to retrieve dump ins. Poised in his zone and masks his intentions on break-out well. He has a heavy point blast. Has some carrying skills but is a better player if paired with a true mailman dee-man. His improvement will hinge upon a few what-ifs, primarily if he can become a more assertive defenseman with more edge, and it seems a certainty that a team will call his name and find out down the road.	He will start his development at the University of Wisconsin."
166,2015,Andrew Mangiapane,"Diminutive OHL winger with a pinpoint accurate shot, a solid stride, quick feet , and both consistent and persistent efforts all over the sheet.  Was basically a walk-on…wasn’t drafted, just won himself a sweater by taking advantage of one scoring opportunity after another. He is a smart positional player, who is always around the puck, and battles, battles battles. The issue is he is 5’ 10” and 160. But will you bet against him?"
156,2015,Jake Massie,"Lanky defender who at this juncture projects as a stay at home defender. At the prep school level shows good awareness and positioning. Displays a good stick, long reach and physicality. He's to fill out, improve all pahses and grow an offensive game.He has committed to the University of Mass.(Amherst)."
162,2015,Chris Wilkie,"High energy wing with great wheels, strong hands, a hard shot and quick release. Reads the offensive zone well and positions himself well in support. Strong defensive zone recognition and aggressiveness. He may be a bit undersized, but displays creativity, commitment and strong defensive end awareness. Great clutch competitor who plays smart both on the attack and in pursuit of turnovers. Has a good hard shot and strong handling ability. Relentless on defense, where he out-manueuvers puck carriers and uses his stick to take the biscuit away. Long term project who needs to read on ice situations better, and play accordingly."
152,2015,Giorgio Estephan,"Late round possiblity, who has decent point totals in the dub, due mostly to his linemates. Has average size and some weight, but his feet seem to deter him from getting to and winning puck battles. Teams will have to decide if he projects as a NHL hopeful."
158,2015,Cooper Marody,Solid high energy winger with excellent acceleration and a set of gears to explode out of a pack and shoot or get to the open area. The question is can he learn to maintain consistency and high intensity level shift by shift and game by game.
154,2015,John Marino,"USA defender with good size who displays decent puck skills and toughness. Plays a solid defensive game with good awareness,footwork, good outlet passing and safe plays all around . A work in progress who needs to use his size to clear the front and bang along the wall. Committed to Yale University NCAA."
151,2015,Radovan Bondra,"A member of his homeland’s team roster for the World Junior Under-20 at Christmas 2014. Displays decent feet but needs improved acceleration and more intensity to his play. Excellent tools, yet no toolbox. Needs more intensity and edge in his pursuit."
150,2015,Ryan Zuhlsdorf,"Blossoming rearguard with great all directional skating ability, and smart puck skills and high end hockey IQ. A fluid skating defenseman who has a big degree of money and hockey sense. High end hockey sense but lacking at least 15-20 pounds at this time. He has good all-direction feet and will allow him to improve further. A no-panic player who has excellent upside.He has committed to the University of Minnesota."
146,2015,Luke Opilka,"Intriguing USA Developmental goaltender from Effingham, Illinois who is impressive in all phases of position. Displays good positioning and anticipation, along with a nice glove and great reflexes Will be attending the University of Wisconsin."
149,2015,Adam Gaudette,Powerful skating three zone centre-wing who uses his excellent edging and low center to be  a scoring threat  when he make high speed decisions on the attack. has high minute totals due to the fact he is strong on the puck and plays well without it. Kills penalties. Committed Northeastern University.
148,2015,Troy Terry,"Colorado-born winger who has a strong skating base and leg drive. His acceleration and power lead to his reception of lead passes in full stride and good finish using his strong wrist shot. Controls the pucks at high speed and can breakthrough opponent’s checks and has displays good passing plays. An aggressive checker looking to take possession of the puck. Still not the polished player, who needs time to improve his vision/reactions and keep possession when he has it. Committed to the University of Denver."
147,2015,Ryan Pilon,A workhorse defender for the WheatKings with edgy physicality and some offensive creativity. Has an excelllent one-timer and a deceptive no-look wrister. Strong tape to tape passer. Started as a player who relied mostly on his physicality but has progressed in other areas. Still need work but all the signs seem to point to this player who has been on the radar for several seasons putting all the pieces together
145,2015,Karel Vejmelka,Big goaltender who plays big as he anchors the front with strong legs and coolness. Has a good glove. Needs to improve rebound control. Leaves little daylight for the shooters.
143,2015,Connor Hobbs,"Crisp tape to tape passer who can carry the mail, but also show a whole lot of grit. Made a surprisingly flawless adjustment to the WHL after playing midget last year. Reads and processes the attack and closes down gaps efficiently. Crisply hits the outlets in transition or has no qualms in bringing it out if the situation exists. Has an exceptional feel for to pass and shoot in attack zone for a first year player. Sure his bow-legged stride needs work and his frame needs filling out, but there is clearly lots to like about the way he plays at this early juncture!"
141,2015,Veeti Vainio,"A Finn offensiveman who needs plenty of development in his own zone, but already displays high end offensive talent with his vision, offensive instincts and pin-point passes. An four-direction skater with tremendous agility and glide that provides him the ability to skate the puck out of his end, using his agility and terrific turns. Can hit a player with a pass at his top speed. Makes soft touch passes, evem with outlets. The question remains if he can put together his game in the defensive zone."
144,2015,Carl Neill,"A big defenseman two-way blueliner who skating and decision making need work, but is smart in his own zone and understands the attack zone although isn’t looking to win games carrying the mail end to end or going out of position to chance a superb defensive takeover. Needs time and refinement."
140,2015,Chase Pearson,Big framed Centre-foward with good hand eye coordination puck skills. Displays a high hockey IQ and understands his coverage in the defensive zone.
138,2015,Spencer Smallman,"Second year eligible with size and a workman-like game. Displays a good all-around game and continues to get better. May not have more than third line upside, but is good in his all-around game. Long term prospect who may surprise."
139,2015,Christian Jaros,"Aggressive hard working and physical stay at home defender who can be calm and composed in his because he understands the play in his end and works really hard to make sure goals are scored while he is out there. It is an unpleasant experience to meet him in front or along the wall. He won’t use his stick to take the puck away - he will take you off the puck. He has great size and good balance for a big man, but is a short strider who does pivot well but does get caught on close one on ones. He has good lateral agility and I would be selling him short to say he isn’t able to skate it out of trouble or surprising mobility when you see him throw an open ice check. Not the most aware or creative guy on the attack, but you can count on his had point shot, and intensity with ever shift. A member of his homeland’s team roster for the World Junior Under-20 at Christmas 2014."
137,2015,Dominik Simon,"Third year eligible centre who never takes a shift off and has a good two-way game, with good passing ability and offensive creativity."
136,2015,Pavel Karnaukhov,"Russian import whose big frame and athleticism make him a patient puck carrier at high speed and is strong on the puck. Receives passes even when outstretching his long stick, and can set up shop in front and get those greasy goals. May project as a strong power player down the road."
135,2015,Kirill Kaprizov,"Undersized fireplug of a wing who was the number one selection in the 2014 KHL draft for Metallurg Novokuznetsk. Quick and agile with great edging, he finds the soft spot and quickly release his shot while at top speed. Good vision and awareness but he must get stronger and bigger to handle the bigger bodies that will be in his way."
134,2015,Matt Schmalz,"Huge centre who has nice hands and exceptional defensive zone presence. Has the quickness to be back on the forecheck with regularity, and is a strong board player at both ends. May never be a highly creative offensive performer but does display good hands. If he was to develop more of an edge as he fills out he could have upside."
131,2015,Matthew Bradley,"Energetic developing winger who plays the game all out. As gritty as they come, he grinds on the opposition like sandpaper with his hits and chirps. Besides displaying the aggressive physical style there is emerging offensive tools, as he has good hands and offensive smarts. It is all a matter of him continuing to pprogress."
133,2015,Joe Cecconi,"Big bodied fluid motioned stay at home defenseman who had his own cheering section at the American Prospects Game in his hometown Buffalo. Displays flashes with a big point shot, willingness to muck it up, ability to play with the puck where he had some nice touch on his passes, and make very good decisions with it.  The real is issue at that game and others you only see tidbits of those strengths, and lots of areas where improvement has to come. Uses his size and strength to his advantage makes solid decisions with the puck and showing poise in his own end. May not have a high level as an offensive attacker but still can help a team by playing inside his abilities while handling the puck.Still a good long term developmental prospect. Committed to the University of Michigan."
129,2015,Sam Ruopp,Big Western League defender with a good compete level and excellent size.  Not afraid to drop ’em. Longer term development prospect.
126,2015,Luke Stevens,Big prep school winger who is just scratching the surface of his developmental curve. Has already improved his balance and skating transforming it smooth stride that allows him to be so much stronger on the puck. Uses his long reach and balance to protect the puck. He has a big booming shot and plenty or raw upside.
128,2015,David Kase,A member of his homeland’s team roster for the World Junior Under-20 at Christmas 2014.
123,2015,Conor Garland,"Small high energy attacking wing who excels in passing the puck and using his dynamic speed to create scoring opportunities. Terrific PP option ala Johnny Hockey. But you can't ignore that he lacks size, strength and the ability to compete strongly for pucks in his end. I don't mean he doesn't attempt taking possession; more that he gets knocked off them and to the ice at times. More of perimeter shooter maybe for his own health. With all said, he still is a more than intriguing draft possibilty."
121,2015,Ryan Shea,Average build defenseman with good vision and offensive savvy. Possesses terrific four-way mobility and has great tools to continue to hone his defensive side. Has strong footwork and lateral movement that signals continued improvement in his gap control. He is difficult to beat one on one. Handles the puck well and loves to activate through his own rushes and passes to become the fourth attacker. Long term project with good upside. He has committed to Northeastern University.
132,2015,Karch Bachman,An undersized left wing who plays hard in the traffic areas even though he is a tad under six foot a stone over 170lbs. Very quick read and react player who creates scoring chances by puck movement and keeping himself in motion. A good strong forechecker with very good speed and perserverance.
120,2015,Mathieu Joseph,"Still very thin, it doesn't hamper his physical intensity or 200 foot commitment. A grinder with  good straight line speed, he presents problems for teams when he is down low. Along with the lunchpail, he brings high hockey IQ along with a good hands. Needs time to get bigger and stronger, and that may help add a bit more explosion to his boots."
117,2015,Caleb Jones,"Younger brother of Seth Jones is a only six foot and a tad under too pounds at this time, but displays an aggressive game from the same position. has lots of mobilty and jump. Has improved much in decisions and his carries, and in his defensive coverage. Feisty player who is good in most phases of the game but hadn’t excelled enough to pull ahead of the bevy of defenseman that may get selected in the later rounds. His development might have changed that."
125,2015,Dmytro Timashov,"Fireplug winger who arguably is the most dangerous player in the entire Q. A 190 lb six foot nine Ukranian/Swedish wing who is fearless in traffic and a gifted offensive playmaker who may have 100 points by season’s end. Hungry to win, and imaginative with the puck. A tremendous stickhandler and agile skater who can make any defender look bad. He basically is a perimeter player who can center of the puck and control it in most areas at high speed while patiently reading his options. You are not drafting a strong defensive player but the trade off is a guy who makes odd-man rushes and match-up challenging the entire game."
116,2015,Glenn Gawdin,"Two-way centre with excellent balance and quick strike capability. Plays the point on the power play, but isn't a true finisher. Can shoot the puck while in stride. and is very light on his edges. Needs to develop physically and he has honed his passing and middle zone work. Can shoot while in flight, and supports his linemates well. Blossoming centreman who is light on his edges and does all the things his lien needs to be successful in support, picks, and screens. Far from physically developed, some team will call his name and hope he fills out his frame, gets stronger and makes a leap to the pro game. Long term prospect who seems to be developing with every game."
118,2015,Jonne Tammela,"Undersized off-handed wing who is good on the cycle and the heavy traffic areas where he fearlessly places himself. Finds pucks in the easy areas, and gets open for one timers. Drives the net."
112,2015,Parker Wotherspoon,"Excellent puck moving defender with a strong shutdown game, and a bit of nasty. Throws hard checks and is always willing to drop’em. Has a really good accurate wrister. Needs to get physically stronger and work on developing a harder slap shot."
113,2015,Brad Morrison,"Wispy thin centre-ing who has great speed, creativity, and competitiveness. Despite his clear need of bulk and muscle, he already contributes strong wall work and fearlessness in the greasy areas. He has shown a strong two way game and feet that add to the high pace nature of his on ice game. A  long term developmental forward who needs time."
111,2015,Ales Stezka,"Tall hybrid goal with a solid glove an blocker. Plays the angles and is positionally strong. Battles hard, but lets things come to him. Displays good rebound control, but may need to work on staying a bit more balanced."
115,2015,Alexandre Carrier,"Smart two-way puck carrying defenseman whose all around game is solid. Good decision maker who plays effective in all game situations. Good without the puck. Needs more bulk and strength, a stronger point shot, and at this point is under six foot."
108,2015,Michael Spacek,"Already displays strong all round game in the Czech elite league but lacks prototypical size. Displays excellent vision, hands and puck control. Can receive hard passes and also sharp soft saucer passes. Forechecks and supports in the defensive zone. A top offensive prospect with scoring touch and passing skills. His head always up and those great hands make it appear the puck is following him around all three zones. He is maybe 5 foot ten at this point and that may be the only negative teams will find in his game. A member of his homeland’s team roster for the World Junior Under-20 at Christmas 2014."
109,2015,Filip Ahl,"Hulking pro-sized wing with an explosive shot that jumps off his blade. Just starting to develop a strong stride and with it much better acceleration. Regardless he is very strong on his skates and a soft passer and playmaker. Still needs to keep his feet moving at both ends, is good on the cycle and stick handles out nicely to get loose and let that big shot go. He beats defenseman with surprising East-West agility. You do want to see a bit more intensity more urgency away from the puck in his end, and use of that big body on the wall with more edginess, but there’s lots to like as he develops his all-around game."
106,2015,Adam Helewka,Second year eligible is a highly-skilled wing who is getting bigger and stronger. Had a 5 point four goal game last Novermber. Displays sound hockey sense and must continue to move to the next level of development. Longer term prospect.
114,2015,Dmitri Zhukenov,"Offensive wing with an array of moves and skills and a tireless attack pace. Far from strong enough but already shows glimspes that he may be a very good player as he ascends the ranks. Makes things happen at top speed, and although under six foot has a bit of sanrl."
102,2015,Denis Malgin,"A small dynamic Swiss scorer whose attack skill cannot be left unnoticed.  A member of his homeland’s team roster for the World Junior Under-20 at Christmas 2014. Still weak on the draw and undeveloped physically, he does see the ice very well and is very shifty, using his vision and stick-handling skills to imaginativey set up linemates. Isn’t strong on the puck and looks as if he presently plays a soft game, but his bread and butter is made with excellent dishes, some at the expense of not taking the shot."
101,2015,Andrei A. Mironov,"Solid two-way contributor to the Russian National Junior team in both the Subway Super Series and the World Junior Tourney. Positionally sound, plays with an edge that makes him a perfect candidate for import from across the pond, and ready to plug-n-play, except for the fact that he is still under contract in the KHL, which might see him going undrafted. Defensive minded, and has a strong tough in your face style, and will try to force his will on the enemy. Solid decision-maker who keeps his composure and also has an up-ice attack game."
100,2015,Anthony Richard,"Undersized high tempo centre with a set of high gears, excellent attack skills, nice vision, relentless forecheck and an aggressive 200 foot game. Fearless in traffic and has a decent release and shot, but there are concerns about his smaller size and if he can play with the same consistency as he climbs the rungs."
105,2015,Jesse Gabrielle,"Truculent wing whose offensive side has taken a big jump forward. Throwback player who finished every check and enjoys engaging any and all in scrums, fights, with a perpetual chips on his shoulders. Still not really six foot, he is a wide, muscular specimen and core strength that grounds him into the ice and has few able to restrain his movements. Has a compact stride and is a very good stickhandler in tight spaces. Can release shots quickly and keeps his feet moving in the attack zone, getting loose and making plays."
110,2015,Joren Van Pottelberghe,"Developing Swiss goaltender with good size. When butterflying he keeps the shoulders up covering the corners. Plays to deep in the net, but has skills that can be honed."
98,2015,Samuel Dove-McFalls,"Physically strong centre-wing who so far hasn't developed a strong offensive game, but has shown improvement in his hands, and foot speed. Can play all three forward positions maintains a soldier-like competitiveness, never quitting to compete and let you know he's there working his bags off. Good wall player and unearths pucks to give his linemates chances. Is good defensively and gets regular PK minutes. May not look like he has a high water mark with his skill, but handles the puck well, and doesn't ever quit on the play, or himself."
97,2015,Colton White,Under-rated defender who plays a relatively mistake-free game with sound decision-making and smart plays and great awareness. Can jump up and activate on offensive.
94,2015,Adam Musil,"A centre with good bloodlines and the versatility to play on all different lines from scoring to checking to energy because he is defensively responsible. A good passer who can also receive pucks while in top flight. Not a real scorer; his shots lack directionality and deceptiveness. Doesn’t have terrific feet, but is improving his mobility, Has good hands and will be aggressive on attacking the one on one defenders before they can go for strips. Strong player on the cycle, and never turns pucks over. Can overhandle the puck or turn his head downward and loses vision of openings his teammates have found. Needs time and development."
92,2015,Will Borgen,"Super sleeper defensive prospect currently six two and growing. Displays strong reads and sense what is unfolding and reacts. At this point has very little offensive game, but that may come since he has excellent vision. Decisively responds to attacks with strong wall work, jam, and break-ups that he quickly turns in transition offensive chances. Loves to take the body on attackers and is very aggressive at middle zone pass break-ups and has a very high panic threshold and keeps himself in motion to stay in play. Makes things look easy by skating to the right places and executing. How offensive side is what identifies him as long term developmental project. Comes from large framed family. He has committed to St. Cloud State."
96,2015,Nicolas Roy,"Tall rangy  centre-forward excellent agility, quickness, skill, and hands. Is poised while in possession, due to his incredibly long reach. Far from an accomplished junior score but has all the attributes that point to him developing as an excellent pro. His feet are what surprises you, how he light he seems and how easily he can bounce from contact to the area the puck is. He crashes the front and his reach gives him advantages. Set up the screen, and uses his size to make plays. Is used as a centre in junior and it gives him more space to work in the offensive end. His work in the defensive aspects is immature and a work in progress. He may project as winger later on."
93,2015,Callum Booth,"Quebec goalie prospect with good size, athleticism and technique. Very good going laterally across the crease, and plays the hybrid style with a calm under intense traffic. Has good bounce; will be up watching the attack forming, go down and cover the lower part of the net and hop right back up as the puck moves outside the dots. Good post presence and awareness. A good developmental prospect."
91,2015,Dennis Gilbert,"Big two way defender who is best when he sticks to a simple game within his comfort level. Decent skater with an active stick. Tough and very willing to box out along the wall in the attack zone. Has balance and can use his girth as leverage to clear the crease area, but his foot speed and puck skills continually put him at risk in his end.  Plays with an active stick and poke check. He continues to improve and has committed to Niagara University where he will be able to develop so he doesn't have issues with the speed game."
99,2015,Austin Wagner,"Power winger who is starting to come into his own on the Pats. He sees little or no powerplay minutes because ehe is oh so very valuable at even strength and one of the better penalty killers in the league. Has a large frame that can easily hold twenty more pounds. His skating strength took an enormous jump and he has gained speed to power to the net, or loose pucks. Quietly becoming a force as he uses his body to finish his checks and makes playing against him quite a task."
88,2015,Thomas Schemitsch,"Technically sound big defender who display significant upside. Plays very composed and also has some edge to his game. His long reach and active stick break up passes and clog the lanes. Has a good first pass and is good at activating when the situation calls for him to join the rush. Although he is showing early signs of handling the defensive side and adding the offensive component, he is going to add some jump. Isn’t that good in the corners due to his lack of quickness, and he loses contain. Really needs to get much better in his stop/starts so he isn’t left behind the developing opposing attack."
95,2015,Jesper Lindgren,"Possible first round sleeper who has come out of nowhere with eye-popping skating, skills and swashbuckling offensive skills. An aggressive offensive player you will jump up in pinches and fake defenders to him and place the puck to an opponent or simply freeze the defender and blow on by. Incredibly cool and confident, with legs and moves that sometimes don’t work, but cause defenders to think about what they might encounter on the next touch. He has elusive puck control that isn’t going to ever stay back if he has an inkling he can make a play. His feet let him get back when the puck is turned over in transition. A bold gunslinger who needs to get stronger, bigger and continue to progress. Displays Karlsson-like attributes and seems on a quick developmental track to the first round if there is a team looking willing to take the chance to watch him progress."
86,2015,Michael Robinson,"Huge goalie prospect who has displayed excellent tools so fra but is going to need more development, refinement  and mentoring to progress. He has committed to the University of New Hampshire."
85,2015,Thomas Novak,"Highly imaginative centre-wing who excelled in last summer’s Ivan Hlinka tournament. Super smooth stickhandler who can do things at high speed. Yes he can score, but his true value comes from his solid three zone repertoire, his relentless puck pursuit, and instinctive patience and imagination with the biscuit. Creates, dominates and finishes. Smart and fearless whether driving the front or trying to get the puck back. An excellent sauce passer who will set teammates up and he’s gone into the dirty areas and battled for it. Always moving and closing to the puck. He wants the puck in crucial times and the fact that he is a natural sniper doesn’t cause many objections. Has really good vision, and anticipation and can project as a pro winger as easily as a pivot. He displays patience and puck control in tight spaces. It now is a matter of him developing into a pro player, which will take time. He has committed to the University of Minnesota."
89,2015,Aleksi Saarela,"A “tweeter” who so far teases with good puck control, good defensive skills, good effort away from the puck but seems to be an average skater with short choppy strides and does create separation and hasn’t shown solid offensive instincts."
81,2015,Brendan Warren,Dominant foward prospect with strong rifle and tremendous puch handling skills. Strong two way wing with great hustle and jump. Wins board battles and drives to the front and creates traffic. Plays bigger than his present size and out-muscles and out plays bigger opposing players. Owns the corners and the wall and strips the puck from the enemy. Dominant at cente and probably can play anywhere up front. A puck possession player with a nifty wrister to boot.
79,2015,Sergei Zborovsky,Big thick Russian defender who is terrific in his end with strong wall work and in the corners. As of yet is not overly interested in the attack game but the ability may come at a later date as he certainly skates well enough and to join the rush. Right now he projects as a possible shutdown type defender.
82,2015,Mitchell Vande Sompel,Undersized developing PP QB who has an improving defensive game. Solid passer in transition and also distributes well in give and goes and on the PP. Uses his feet  in the defensive zone to rub attackers off and take off back out. Gives himself time to survey the ice and then make a pass. Improving player who isn’t there yet but shows encoring parts to his game
84,2015,Deven Sideroff,"A leading scorer in the Canadien Sport School Hockey League, he has graduated and made a smooth transition onto the Blazer’s roster. He is light on his edges, good in traffic and a tight space shooter with plenty of touch."
90,2015,Matej Tomek,"An athletic Slovakian import who has soundly placed himself in the conversation as possibly being the first goaltender drafted. He was clearly heads over tails better than any other prospect at the NAHL showcase event. Shows a good down low came with quick legs. Has good balance while in his stance, and terrific quickness and anticipation. Good at absorbing shost and limiting rebounds. Covers the top of the net and is flexible enough in recovery and reposition for the second shot he does give up."
83,2015,Jens Lööke,"Interesting sleeper who is averaged sized, but has significant upside based on his all-around skill and puck handling ability. Really strong on the puck and a deft passer on the move. Has a variety of fakes and can convince defenders he is taking the shot while he is making time for one of his teammates to actually get the puck to make the play. Has good instincts and good handling the biscuit on the PP. Has shown improving compete level at both ends and must continue to be a better player when he doesn’t possess it. Was on his homeland’s team roster for the World Junior Under-20 at Christmas 2014."
78,2015,Erik Foley,"Another quality US-born prospects who is an excellent forechecker, and fearless ""take it to 'em"" forward. A good passer and emerging offensive skills. Has gotten physically bigger and added some girth.  Don't believe those who think he cannot handle the rough going; he is very good in the battle areas and on the wall. It is just a matter of growing his entire game a bit more and committing to Providence College will give him the time to develop both his physical and hockey side."
80,2015,Brent Gates,"Big strong scoring left winger who is a consistent force down low. Good on the cycle and strong in puck battles in the dirty areas. Parks himself in front, and is able to push his way anywhere he wants. Has an active stick and played of the penalty kill for his club in the All-American Prospects game. Committed to the University of Notre Dame."
74,2015,Alexander Dergachev,"Displays vision, soft hands and a frame that let’s him bull his way around. A member of his homeland’s team roster for the World Junior Under-20 at Christmas 2014."
77,2015,Samuel Montembault,"Buddlng goalie prospect with good athleticism, and flexibility. Shows good unflappable style when the crease area is full of traffic. Gets good push going side to side, and set ups up well for the second and third shots."
72,2015,Anthony Cirelli,"Highly competitive and energetic defensively reliable centre with decent foot speed and does mnay things well but none outstanding at this juncture. Has an active stick and is an excellent backchecker Committed to St. Lawrence University, where he will get the chance to develop his core muscles and adds strength to his wide stride."
70,2015,Felix Sandstrom,"Another solid Swedish goal prospect who has flexibility, great mechanics, solid positioning  and a calm demeanor. As with many Euro-tenders, he sometimes gets under the bar. Has displayed the ability to stop breakaway shooters coming in one on one. Difficult to beat low, and very quick reactions to the play. This season was not best due to mono and various injuries."
73,2015,Vili Saarijärvi,Undersized dee-man who is a good puckhandler and up-ice puck carrier. Very competitive and fearless in his play. Reads the ice well in both ends.  Can avoid pressure from forecheckers and make the transition pass.  Has good vision. QBs the powerplay. Has strong recovery speed to get back after activating. Despite his size he comes ready to play against players larger than his stature.
67,2015,Blake Speers,"Intriguing developmental forward who plays with a short stick and still manages great control of the biscuit and superb accuracy to his shots. Dangerous on the due to his elite speed. Lets go strong snap shots, using defensemen as his screens. Needs to increase his work ethic and stay fully involved and be less of a passenger. Needs to work hard to get open, and get involved more in both zones.Needs to br bigger and stronger."
66,2015,Guillaume Brisebois,"Captain’s a weak Titan team and is good at both ends.  Very thin, but still willing and able to use his frame to knock puck carriers. Maintains good gaps and plays solid despite the lack of depth around him.  At this juncture is more a defense-first place but he may still round out his offensive game."
75,2015,Daniel Vladar,"18 year old goal prospects don’t come in “plug & play” form. They are projections who talent is honed over long period of years with hopes they eventually lead to the pro game. It is rare to find 6 foot 5 inch guys with considerable natural skill, tools and athleticism. In him you see very little technique just lots and lots of upside. He moves so well from side to side, and battles hard on the 2nd and 3rd shots. He has quick legs and feet and is tough to beat down low. Very flexible with great reflexes, he has much to learn in terms of positioning, honing softer pads and improving his glove. Hasn’t stopped playing the Urostyle where the goalie gets a bit too far into the netting. His technique, but his upside is undeniable.A member of his homeland’s team roster for the World Junior Under-20 at Christmas 2014."
63,2015,Kyle Capobianco,"Mobile offensiveman with fluid motion and elusiveness on the attack. Sees the ice well, read coverages, and waits for the right moment to place the puck on the sticks of forwards breaking out. has a good shot, and has little trouble engaging on the wall. A top scorer on a weak team, he is far from ready part of his addition development will be getting stronger and quicker in his first steps. Really does not possess much physicality, and is refining his decisions in both ends. He might grow into an NHL defenseman."
61,2015,Jeremy Bracco,"Early on, there have been many comparisons of this youngster to Patrick Kane. I think that is big stretch but I do see skills in him that might warrant the comparison. He is an undersized player with flash, magician-like soft hands and superb stick-handling skills that cause defenders fit in one-on-one situations. Takes full advantage of his light frame and quick feet to blow by defenders. There is much more to the pro game like unearthing pucks and working physically along the boards to gain possession, and handling your man on the backcheck. This is the part of his game that determine where a team selects him. A member of his homeland’s team roster for the World Junior Under-20 at Christmas 2014."
62,2015,Robin Kovacs,"Big bodied wing good on the cycle and down low. Good forechecker who can also create chances. Never takes shifts off and is playing with much more consistency. He is best when he has a bit of space, like when he is busting in in full flight and quickly releases his wrist shot.  He is starting to get comfortable in traffic , but must upgrade his quickness, strength and awareness as he develops."
69,2015,Keegan Kolesar,"A rugged win who also has pretty soft hands. Big and willing to do whatever helps to et the win. You know you played against him, as he competes his bags off, going very hard not the corners and delivering hits that hurt. Very rugged and an agitator who will drop the gloves with anyone. Not a goon;plays a honest hard game much to the liking of his teammates but to the dislike of their opponents. Always one of the most consistent players on his team in every game. A top six candidate who can eventually be a physical force on an NHL roster due to his size, edge and unmatched work ethic."
71,2015,J. C. Beaudin,"Hard working centre-wing who moves well and disrupts things fearless down low, Tirelessly works in all three zones, and has improving offensive characteristics. Not very physical and his feet need work, but has good tools and leads by example."
65,2015,Andrew Nielsen,"Physical Dub defender who has good short area mobility and an active stick. His skating is a work in progress, but it hasn't deter him because positions himself well, and hold gaps. really good head and reads the attack and also sees his outlets well. Displays a good shot, good passes, and although doesn't overplay the puck, when his coordination and feet catch up to his size, he may improve there."
55,2015,Yakov Trenin,"Huge, strong skilled and good all 200 feet, just not the fastest guy, but has great hands and creates chances for linemates."
58,2015,Kevin Stenlund,"Big sized quick playmaker who moves well, has a quick release, soft hands, and shiftiness. Already has the height, range and growing muscle, and now must increase his acceleration and first step jump. Teams will expect him to use his size in both the defensive and attack zones more than he has displayed. Really good passer and deceptive shooter who will get consideration as longer developmental guy."
64,2015,Dennis Yan,"Highly skilled winger with excellent speed, first step and offensive instincts. A natural goal scorer finds the open space and buries his chances. Displays a lightning fast release, and hard shot. Flies around the net and finds the soft spots in coverage, always involving himself in high traffic areas.  He is a scorer but also an offensive generator, with soft hands and great balance at high speed. Surprisingly physical in pursuit of the puck, and a good forechecker. Needs to balance his offensive prowess with lots more work in his defensive zone."
54,2015,Graham Knott,"Left wing prospect with a nice frame whose has all-around game and makes any linemate a good player. Outstanding straight line speed., but needs to improve his balance. Plays well in all areas and comes to play shift after shift. He has strength but needs to get better in the battle areas. Very consistent and was able to outplay the opposition and winning puck battles again and again. Can get bigger all round. And improving in the tight spaces and capitalizing there is what might elevate his draft status."
52,2015,Jérémy Lauzon,"Underrated Q dee-man who has excellent mobility, size and sufficient toughness to project to high levels."
53,2015,Rasmus Andersson,"He was selected to the roster for the World Junior Under-18 Tournament in April, 2013 as a player almost two years younger than the rest, save Connor McDavid. An impact type blue-liner who has tremendous vision, and instincts. Heavy shooter who can lead the rush, or guide it from the backline. Superb passer who leads many of the transitional rushes. Smooth strong skater who is positionally very strong and able to read and adjust in his zone, along with his ability to contribute offensively. Strong and thick already, he will work on quickness and defensive side of the game. Another intriguing Swedish hopeful who was on the radar very early, maybe due to the fact his Father is a former NY Ranger and has had an older brother already selected. He is another early touted player that hasn’t continued to rise from his early press billings. Extremely poised and gifted as a puck carrier and distributor, due to excellent vision and touch, but seems to have not regained his early swagger in his possessions. This is his first year in the OHL, and had a season in the Swedish Allsvenskan the year before. Needs to stay patient but also not overplay his possessions. Needs a whole lot more snark and physicality in his own end, and if he can add that to his already strong tools as a puck-carrier and PP guy, he may get his name called early."
56,2015,Vince Dunn,"Six foot defender with excellent puck skills and mobility. Loves to jump up in the play offensively. Good breakout passer who evades the forecheck and makes the accurate pass in transition. Good one on one take on skills as a defender, and plays well man to man defensively. Handles attackers on the wall and plays big enough to win the puck battles in his own end."
51,2015,Brendan Guhle,"Longer term prospect who is very thin and undersized at this juncture. Terrific four-direction skater with great acceleration and stop/start qualities. Smart decision maker on defense and up ice. Effortless jump in his boots and has great edging. It will take time while he grows his game and gets bigger and stronger, but there looks to be a reward in his selection."
47,2015,Jansen Harkins,Total team player who does all the little things to help his team win. An unselfish centre
45,2015,Jakob Forsbacka-Karlsson,"When he left Sweden for North America, we viewed him a one of the top two-way centres that would be available this year, but he seems to have stalled in attempting to reach his high water mark offensively. Don’t get me wrong: the team that selects him get a strong two way pivot who is smart, dependable and willing to do all the little things need to be done, never slacking in work ethic. He blocks shots, and will relish being the guy supposed to defensively shut their top centre late in the game. He does carry the puck well and also can make those high end plays with terrific passes to his wingers. It may be that he has taken it upon him self to do too much, but he is forcing plays and has declined in ability confidently make that simple play, sometimes over-thinking things and having plays broken up. Needs to pick up his pace and intensity. He was selected to the roster for the World Junior Under-18 Tournament in April. There is still a lot to like as we watch his progression before the Spring."
57,2015,Jonas Siegenthaler,A member of his homeland’s team roster for the World Junior Under-20 at Christmas 2014.
49,2015,Roope Hintz,"A member of his homeland’s team roster for the World Junior Under-20 at Christmas 2014, the lanky wing who is a good skater with good speed and nice acceleration. A good back checker. Displays average hands and his skill projects him to possibly be a bottom six player, when he fills out and improves his balance. Has some qualms about going into the battle zones on the attack, and does rush things when he gets the biscuit. More of a perimeter shooter who needs to learn patience and better control of the puck in the attack zone. Is strong in puck pursuit but just not overly aggressive, physical or creative. Long term potential wing who needs time and development."
48,2015,Filip Chlapik,Displays good hockey sense and game and all the attributes to continue his developmental climb. Has good touch and strong puck control. Has good playmaking skills and makes good decisions and patience when carrying. Plays song on his skates and has good speed and first step quickness to go around defenders on the rush and then to the net. It is difficult to separate him from the puck. Works hard in his defensive zone and come back for make his defenseman’s outlet pass easier. A good back-checker. He still needs to get better offensively and also develop more lateral agility.
43,2015,Erik Cernak,"Slovack player who’s seems a long way from being ready and even a pretty long shot of getting his name called in the late rounds. Has great size, but seems to have limited strength. He hasn’t matured enough to think the game well, or anticipate well, or deliver any hits or dish out some physicality in blue paint battles. Seems to have limited upside in that his passes aren’t great, his defensive positioning is average and his footwork needs improvement. A member of his homeland’s team roster for the World Junior Under-20 at Christmas 2014. This is a player who has a chance to be good as long as he plays within the confines of his limitations at this point. he is a long-term development choice, who tops out as a top four defender who plays with robust in his end, and makes the outlet pass, but doesn't have high skill or impact attack skills."
44,2015,Matthew Spencer,"Great skater with strong puck handling ability and all around smarts.  Nasty to play against and pounds the enemy relentlessly. Makes a solid first pass. Has a quick release. Strong on his pins and is willing to pinch in and then battle through defender after defender and make point of blowing them up. In his own zone he makes a point to explode in contact behind his net, and opposing forwards don’t like venturing into his side of the ice. Utilized his defensive partner when under pressure. May be an up and comer"
50,2015,Jordan Greenway,"They don’t come much bigger than this promising winger who displays a lot more than size.  Has vey quick feet for such a large man, and shows power in his stride. Emerging puck skills and good feet, coupled with his strong wall presence make him a strong candidate for selection in the first round if he continues to improve. Since he was 15, he was bigger, better and stronger than his competition. His gifts may start there, but the skill and soft hands are what put him on the upward spiral."
41,2015,Ryan Gropp,Has the frame of a power forward and excellent leg drive and balance. Has good speed and scoring ability. Well disciplined and deliberate on the attack and in his own zone. shows promise as a future sniper. He gets to loose pucks and uses his balance to win along the wall. There are long spaces when he seems to do little to impact a game despite his speed size and abilities. Still needs to improve his work in the defensive zone.
42,2015,MacKenzie Blackwood,"Tall acrobatic netminder whose aggressive style includes super-quick leg and mobility. Moves really well from side. Loves to challenge shooters and gets out on the edge of the paint to cut down their net. Aggressive goalie prospect whose is very athletic, acrobatic, and positional sound at the junior level. Always ready to challenge attackers and has lightning quick less that stop the low shots with regularity. His big frame and natural mobility allow him to slide from post to post easily. Already had soft pads that help control rebounds. Will need to work on his puck-handling but he seems guaranteed to have his name called early this Spring."
39,2015,Anthony John Greer,"Playing on talent laden BU roster, his opportunities and heavier workload are yet to come. It’s apparent he can make an impact in some way in every shift. Excellent size, athleticism and feet. his strong on his skates and defenders have trouble detering him from going where he wants, usually a drive to the net, maybe even taking up shop there. Displays a heavy shot, good passing ability and the desire to win. Will get thicker and his role at BU will expand, so the team that selects him might end up with a real solid left winger."
40,2015,Nicolas Meloche,"Usually young defenders who display strong two way game don't come with a full package and toolbox. Not so here. He is player who is strong positionally but also displays mobility and strong physicality. Already mature in his understanding of his position. He takes attackers to the outside, with good gaps and timing. Outstanding in his own end.Retrieves many of those pucks and quickly advances them with quick outs. Reads the outlets and is precise in his passes, causing odd-man breaks at the other end. Is developing as pointman on the PP. Will walk in along the wall to open things, and is also starting to walk the blue line to set up the attack on the PP. A big man with excellent mobility, who throws hard hits Looks destined to go early."
36,2015,Gabriel Gagné,"Giant winger with soft hands who is far from close to a finished product in that he seems lackadaisical in his effort, use of his feet, and overall results in most phases except him positioning himself in front of the crease on the powerplay. Is a decent skater but needs major jump in conditioning, skating and leg strength."
35,2015,Sebastian Aho,Undersized waterbug with great jump and skills He was selected to the roster for the World Junior Under-18 Tournament in April.
46,2015,Daniel Sprong,"An undersized winger who can make it rain on the power play. Shifty and opportunistic and strong on his skates. Slips away and finds the soft spot and wants the puck. Exceptional athlete who despite an undersized frame will not be taken off the puck. Although he may not project as high as a second line contributor, he has been his team’s key PP player, because he set up teammates with cross-ice feeds as well as having one terrific shot. Don’t make the mistake of thinking he can’t beat you from many areas with his deadly shot and exceptional set-ups, because he will. The questions will come as what exactly is his high-water mark."
32,2015,Christian Fischer,Naturally strong lunchpail wing who does have good feet and power wing capabilities. Won’t blow opponents over with his puck handling of decks. He understands his role. He works the wall gets the puck to his skilled linemates and relishes his chances to stand in front and get rewarded. Pretty selfless and willing the muck it up to get things going. Committed to University of Notre Dame.
34,2015,Travis Dermott,"Under six foot defender who is built thick and hard. Has excellent hockey IQ and is a very good puck-handler and passer. Excellent outlet passer in transition, and will activate on the attack. Longer term prospect who has characteristics and abilities that point to him as a pro prospect."
38,2015,Paul Bittner,"Lanky winger with plenty of potential. Was named to the USA Developmental team playing in the Ivan Hlinka Tournament. Emerging Western League winger with great size, strength and solid skills. Displays prototypical size, along with toughness and a strong shot. Displays a wide skating base with powerful stride that will give the opposition fits as adds even more muscle. Projects as a power forward excellent feet for a big man. A strong skater with a powerful stride making him difficult to check. He effectively creates space and read the set-ups well from the neutral in. Keeps his feet going on the wall and corners. Plays on the special teams effectively. Possesses tremendous smarts, vision, mobility, maturity, and over-all skill set that may apart from much of the class as time goes on.Has good awareness and hockey smarts and excellent vision, a long reach that combined with his above average hands project as a formidable pro."
33,2015,Mitchell Stephens,"Versatile and passionate right winger who plays in all situations including PK and PP. Makes very good puck decisions and is a smart passer who distributes the puck on the attack whether it be back to the point or to the open man, or firing it on net. An excellent neutral zone player who, after intercepting pucks caught the opposition flat-footed as he entered his attack zone. Not a big guy but has adequate size. Needs more muscle and a lot more jam when working the wall."
29,2015,Gabriel Carlsson,"Huge Swedish defender who has a heavy point shot, excellent compete level and  a good grasp of reading the ensuing play. Is seldom rattled and battles hard in his end. Makes that transition first pass. His skating needs to continue improving so he can better maintain gap control. His backward mobility and forward acceleration need refinement."
27,2015,Jacob Larsson,"Developing Swedish defender with size, strong North-South leg drive, a long reach, and first pass break out capability. A work in progress who needs to fill in and to improve his skating stride."
26,2015,Noah Juulsen,Thin six foot defender who plays tough but clean game and gets time on both special teams. Has been asked to be the shutdown defender and is looking like a solid two way player.
28,2015,Anthony Beauvillier,Slippery undersized left winger from the Q who compact stride give him short areas rocket bursts in the attack zone. Plays with intensity and sneaks into the open spot to receive passes.  Not the best shortest player on the puck when he carries for long periods.
25,2015,Jack Roslovic,"One of the best players on the USA-NTDP team, he is of average height and weight at this juncture, but will grow bigger and stronger. A relentless never take a shift off winger who has excellent instincts and IQ for the game. Very good in the heavy traffic areas and on the the wall. Creates turnovers on the forecheck and when he has the puck in the attack zone, he keeps the pistons churning strong on the puck in tight space. He has excellent anticipation and get himself open in the prime scoring areas, and is good on the give and go. A shifty guy with really goods hands and puck handling ability. Saucers the puck really well and can receive and dish at high speed. Unselfish, passionate player whose future is looking upward. Committed to the University of Miami of Ohio."
24,2015,Travis Konecny,"Another one of the top end elite skaters and puck movers in the class, with excellent edging, burst and agility. Has the ability to go into tight spaces and control the puck and dictate play. You will see him involved in all three zones, giving strong work ethic in his end and quick bursts to loose pucks or throw checks. His compete level is bigger than his stature so might see him getting bounced a bit along the wall in those puck battles. Simply takes no quarter. The lack of size might be an advantage when he pushes his way through crowds to reach scoring areas, receive passes, and take shots. A player who clearly has a quick release and deceptively strong wrist and snapshots, but is very comfortable distributing the puck and using his smarts to read and react to the defense with slick set-ups. There is much to like about this young man."
23,2015,Brock Boeser,"Slippery centre-forward who is patient and disciplined when in control of the puck. Displays excellent feet and bursts. can stop/start very quickly and his agility and separation skills and agility can cause fits in defenders. Makes plays by drawing in defenders, going laterally, then times perfect passes to his wingers that were able to jump free while he held on. Always keeps feet going when he doesn’t have the puck, and gets loose from his checks in scoring areas. Seems like more of a scorer than a strong set-up man. Needs to get a stronger presence on the wall and stay involved when he doesn’t have the puck on his stick. Has committed to the University of Minnesota."
30,2015,Nick Merkley,"Undersized “Dub” centre/forward with good all around skills and edge. A good skater who can turn into the middle and dish. Very good player from behind the net, whose speed gives him opportunities as he come out. Started the 2014-15 season with league leading point / assist totals. Shorter but very thick. Very willing to get froggy for his team when they are down in a contest and they need some physical. His fireplug frame gives strong body contact and also absorbs the ones returned. A player we will be watching."
21,2015,Colin White,"Possesses average size, but high end skills and smarts. Opportunistic scorer who can make plays at high speed with some edge. Moves well laterally, and has a quick stick to control loose pucks, and cause turnovers. Anticipates the pass and needs little time to unload his big-time shot. Possesses a quick release and superb accurancy with his shots. Top player on US Under-17 Team in the past. A solid forechecker and responsible two-way centre. Pressures the opposition and steals pucks that he quickly turns into scoring opportunities. Very strong on the puck because of his solid skating and balance. Projects as a NHL point producer."
18,2015,Thomas Chabot,Athletic puck moving defender who has made big strides in a year in the QMJHL.
37,2015,Brandon Carlo,"Projections have a lot to do with selections. When teams see a Colorado-born six foot five defender who handles the defensive side quite well they all look forward to a emerging offensive side to go along with that 200 foot smarts he displays. Very slight for his height, he has plenty of room to grow into a player who can take on into a bigger role. A team will call his name and wait to see if his hockey IQ helps spawn a bigger offensive presence. A member of his homeland’s team roster for the World Junior Under-20 at Christmas 2014."
15,2015,Zachary Senyshyn,"Underrated OHL hard working winger who pays a smart tough well-rounded game. Good physically strong player on the boards and good acceleration and power on the attack. Always in on the backcheck, and although he isn't a lateral skating dynamo, he uses his North-South speed to get moving to the front and stay there when then the attack ensues. Big and powerful, and never takes a shift off."
14,2015,Jake DeBrusk,"Displays improving offensive upside to his aggressive style. Will cut to the front and beat defenders wide. Loves to die and cars the net. Has a wide skating base and he holds his ground in the paint. He isn’t a slick stick-handler or strong finisher at this juncture, but there is much to like that is already in place."
20,2015,Joel Eriksson Ek,Strong competing centre who plays solid in all zones. A player who at an earlier juncture projected as a low-end roster player who is strong in the dot and very responsible defensively. He is smart and comes to win every night. It isn’t like he is a deft speedster;but he most certainly continues to improve his feet and continue on the uptick as a smart strong-on-the-puck player who reads the situations and knows when to continue carrying and when to find the teammate with a pass. He needs more strength but is strong in traffic and creates space on the attack. He supports well defensively and always instinctively position himself well. He will continue to fill his gangly body out and get even stronger than he already is. There are glimpses of strong offensive instincts that may flourish as he fills out physically. Already creates space and excels in the dot.A long term player who some team will take a chance on.
13,2015,Jakub Zboril,"Emerging defenseman with good size/skill ratio. Displays excellent vision as a first year player in the ""Q"" who has superb four direction skating ability. Very elusive when carrying, and really good at closing the gaps when defending. Has shown he can ride attackers to the wall and check them hard when away from it. Poised and quick to make that accurate pass in transition. Is smart and patient on the PP where he makes use of his hard low shot, or move the biscuit to the option. Still learning and far form the polished player on the backline. He still has mishandles and lapses in judgement due to bad positioning and sloppiness I will defer to his newness to the higher competition.  Needs a stronger commitment and full game commitment, but there's much to like."
17,2015,Kyle Connor,"A responsible up and down centre-wing with excellent skating ability and feel for the attack zone. He is smart with the puck and his soft mitts allow him to hit linemates on the move, or put his hard shot on the net.  Finds the open space and creates scoring chances. Has an extra gear that he can hit to get to that scoring lane. Is a patient puck-handler who can slow things down in order to break them open. Needs more credit for being a finisher, as he really can score, even though he is always willing to use his feet and then send a soft pass to a teammate. Not a hard nosed wall player but will engage. Smooth skating winger with soft hands and good instincts. His deceptive stride shows excellent acceleration which he uses to get by pairs of defenders and able to get of quality chances. When he shows more edge, intensity and activity in the high traffic areas we will be sold. Like so many youngsters, his defensive game is a work in progress. He does come back. He needs to get more overall strength and when that comes he will be not only more able to be physical but also an even stronger puck carrier. Was named to the USA Developmental team playing in the Ivan Hlinka Tournament the last two years . Was named to the U.S. World Junior A roster for the Junior A Challenge. Committed to the University of Michigan."
16,2015,Mathew Barzal,Creative player with excellent vision who skates well with a wide base and strong stride. Responsible 200 foot player whose seeps with offensive upside. He plays with speed and has a good understanding of utilizing all his resources in the attack zone.
31,2015,Jérémy Roy,"Elite skating defender who is compact-sized but whose offensive prowess and skating burst is giant-sized. An aggressive attacker who also uses his acceleration, powerful leg drive,  and stick to get back in position after the puck goes back in transition. He plays fairly physical and handles attackers and the front and has decent gap control and stays with attackers. His true strength is his as a dynamic attacker and puck carrier who understands the tempo and can slow down the play but also feels in an instant that window to aggressively explode the zone with either an aggressive pass or even by going straight into the slot and letting the puck fly. Very solid puck handler who is strong on his carries but also precision-like in his outlets and set-ups."
19,2015,Evgeny Svechnikov,Big bodied Russian import who hands and feet can at times make him a dominant player in games. Has a good shot and feet. Possesses a big frame that has room for more weight. A member of his homeland’s team roster for the World Junior Under-20 at Christmas 2014.
11,2015,Lawson Crouse,"A big man with an excellent size/skating package. Gets in quickly and handles the forecheck and control the play along the boards. Can control things in the crease area, and has a big time heavy shot and release. Is strong on the puck, and gets through contact, and can drive the net. Very high hockey IQ, and anticipates the play well."
8,2015,Zack Werenski,"A fine all-around defensive prospect who displays all the qualities necessary to progress as an NHL defender. He is very mobile player who passes thread the needle on tight breakout passes. Smartly activates into the attack with explosion causing matchup problems for the opposition. Smart and gifted point man who effortlessly walks the blue line to open lanes on the PP. Excellent lateral mobility on dee. Closes down on the wall. He is going to need time and with improve gap control and hopefully add more aggression, using his big frame more. A member of his homeland’s team roster for the World Junior Under-20 at Christmas 2014. Might easily be the best ready to defend"" defenseman in the class. He will make a seamless transission to the NHL quickly."
12,2015,Denis Gurianov,"Pro-style wing whose powerful legs get him to the front. Has shown his superiority, starting in the Five Nations Tourney, by making plays and taking shots while completely covered due to the size and hands. Terrific heavy shot and quick release. Strong board player and and on the cycle. Plays a 200 foot game with strong defensive commitment. Potentially a top end pro-style wing prospect who gets most boxes checked in terms of size, skill, skating, hockey sense, hands and power. His powerful stride makes him almost unstoppable as he goes were he pleases and can release his cannon shots while defenders attempt to drape themselves on him. Strong three zone player who is very responsible on the back check. Owns the wall and his powerful stride lets him bull his way towards the net and unleash the puck while in full-flight. Was the biggest standout in the World Junior A Challenge were he was dangerous on most of his shifts. There is always a question with the Russian prospects who haven’t committed to coming over to North American. Are they willing, will they adjust to the culture/language, or feel more comfortable to stay home?"
9,2015,Timo Meier,Wide bodied six foot Swiss winger whose improved feet and more robust play in the Q has him in the scout’s sights. Good battle zone player who needs further work on his acceleration and starts. Very skilled but still on the low end of the learning/development curve in terms of thinking the North American game and instinctively reacting. A work in progress who was a member of his homeland’s team roster for the World Junior Under-20 at Christmas 2014.
5,2015,Noah Hanifin,"Large two way defender who displays good vision and on ice smarts. Is a mobile fluid defenseman who has an excellent offensive upside to match his edgy defensive side. Four-direction skater who has great vision, poise, and makes the best plays on most shifts."
7,2015,Ivan Provorov,"A strong elusive skating puck carrier who is also great with his stick as a defensive weapon. This improving six foot skates head up with confidence great knee bend and drive, holding that extra second and always aware of all his passing options. Attacks with shake and bake head and body moves and gets by defenders on the attack. Reaches quickly on defense. Still needs polish defensively but has upside that will most certainly have his name called. A member of his homeland’s team roster for the World Junior Under-20 at Christmas 2014."
10,2015,Mikko Rantanen,"Displays a strong game on the wall and dominance below the circles. Has excellent vision, playmaking skills, and above average feet an effort in all three zones. He is very strong on the puck and uses his size to control play, bring havoc in the front and when he gets the puck it’s tough to get it from him, whether it is in the cycle or when he moves out off the wall. Seems very in control in his carries. He has solid jump and speed and the vision to find openings. If there was a knock it would be his low scoring totals so far. One could argue he wasn’t playing with pivot able to get him the biscuit. Others might say he lacks the high end soft and quick hands, foot speed and agility when passes are sent his way. He has spent time on IR, but is a very intriguing prospect. He was selected to the roster for the World Junior Under-18 Tournament in April and also was a member of his homeland’s team roster for the World Junior Under-20 at Christmas 2014."
3,2015,Dylan Strome,"Needs very little time and space to let quality chances fly off his stick. He does tend to hold the biscuit and try to one man the play when he could use his linemates. That may be because he has high confidence in his handling abilities, and his ability to put the eventually puck wherever he wants. If he keep his game simple he can be part of a dominating unit. He is great at finding a place for himself in the slot and get his stick on shots or his devastating wrist shot go. Has shown in junior all the attributes you look for in projecting a prospect to the pro game: Speed, power, vision, and high end hands that help him carve the attack zone piece by piece. Has a willingness to work the wall and his reach and speed win many 50/50 puck battles. The only negative might be that his defensive effort has been questioned and that it appears on many shifts, he can go unnoticed or just seems to be invisible. (In perspective, there are very few prospects whom this description doesn’t apply.)"
1,2015,Connor McDavid,"One of the most talked about prospects in awhile, he was granted exceptional player status by Hockey Canada, and became just the third player to be granted the draft exemption behind New York Islanders forward John Tavares and current Barrie Colts defenceman Aaron Ekblad.  In April 2012, he was named the GTHL’s player of the year after scoring 33 goals and 39 assists for 72 points in only 33 games with the Marlies. Incredible on-ice vision, and can control play at top speed. Possesses all-direction skating ability and great acceleration that compliments his high-end skill-set. His vision, IQ, skating and hands make his a threat with every touch. Plays at such an exceptionally high tempo that he is a threat whenever he is on the ice. He was selected to the roster for the World Junior Under-18 Tournament in April, 2013. and was also a member of his homeland’s team roster for the World Junior Under-20 at Christmas 2014."
6,2015,Pavel Zacha,"Big man who has a strong physical game, excellent hands and really good shot. Not the fastest guy at this point but very strong on his pins and well balanced, and uses his size and reach to wear down the opponents. Good in the battle areas and goes hard to the front. At this juncture prefers to hold the puck, try and deke out  defenders and shoot than to look for linemates. His arrival in the OHL will be his chance to get better all around, and build an even stronger game., and he has shown solid performances at both ends. Plays major minutes, and despite not being a dazzling stickhandler, still manages to dominate and take opponents off the puck, with strong wall work. He plays strong on the puck and never stops working. Displays a quick release and hard heavy shot. He sees the ice, gets open and has at times, high end touch with his passes along with that vision. Even though he may get projected as a future NHL winger, he is for lack of a better name a ""shoot-first"" centre. This unselfish team first player continues to improve his skating but, at this juncture, where his feet are may determine where he eventually gets selected. Can he improve and be a first line NHL player? That's the question. A member of his homeland’s team roster for the World Junior Under-20 at Christmas 2014."
2,2015,Jack Eichel,"The US born centre may not be as good as the top guy but he sure looks like a generational player in his own right. He is a quick off the face-off circle skater who can jump onto defender can get pucks before they know it. A power player who could also project to wing, because he has tremendous jump, balance and punch when he engages. So light on his edges, with a powerful long stride, and a really long reach, he is beyond dangerous with the puck. Finds himself the open spaces. Can enter and exit the face-off circle with the the puck and ramp to high gear and let it go as quick as the best. Reads situations and can go end to end like the 200 foot player he is. Plays centre and is very good there, but his quick release and wall work might have teams projecting him as a attack winger too. He is a lunchpail team player with impact player toolbox. He was selected to the roster for the World Junior Under-18 Tournament in April. Already committed to Boston University where he began with strong goal and point totals from the onset. There's no doubt in my mind he could dethrone McDavid, based on his all-around smarts and play. So many of the recent early first rounders are kept on the NHL rosters because the braintrust think they better off developing there, and giving the fans a look at what might be coming. In Eichel's case, you will see him take a top centre role away from someone, because he is a game-changer from shift one. A member of his homeland’s team roster for the World Junior Under-20 at Christmas 2014."
203,2017,Ryan O'Connell,"Displays great wheels and puck carrying skills. Has soft hands and is good in his distribution coming out of his end. He is committed to Boston College, where he will work to improve all the other aspects."
200,2017,"Samuel ""Sammy"" Walker",Committed to the University of Minnesota.
199,2017,Cayden Primeau,"Yet another impressive, big goaltender with mental toughness, excellent flexibility, good co-ordination and reflexes. Plants himself well. Almost always makes the first stop. Tracks the puck well, and makes many key saves. He can get his pad flat and slide cross crease, staying square to the shooter. Needs work on rebound control and must control his desire to get out too far. Committed to Northeastern University."
201,2017,Logan Cockerill,"Undersized wing with high end skill and breakaway speed. A relentless puck pursuer who ranks as one of the best skaters (speed and acceleration) in the class. Backs defender because the fear he will beat them one on one, if they close the gap. Always in motion and generating chances. Committed to Boston University."
198,2017,Skyler McKenzie,"Fearless small man is a second year eligible wing has enjoyed a super productive 80 plus point season with the Winterhawks. He is counted upon to be an all situation player who blocks shots, and sacrifice his body in any situation. You can argue that he benefits from playing on Cody Glass’s wing, but they actually feed off each others play. A key penalty-killer. Displays a quick release that helped him reach a 42 goal season. Some teams may go after this player despite his diminutive size."
4,2015,Mitch Marner,"Has abundant skill, speed, agility, and quick hands that makes him a threat on every touch. A hard worker who uses his gifts as a relentless forechecker, attacker and scorer. Reads the play and is a good set up man besides being a 200 foot home run end to end attacker. Clearly not a kid man but still is willing to attack the front, work the corners and engage with the enemy whenever necessary. He works hard to get pucks back, no matter the price. Great combination of hand-eye-feet speed and edging that set him apart from most of the others in the Canada Under-18 camp. His strength is his great lateral agility and ability to keep possession through countless defenders, read the options, and then place a soft pass on to a teammate’s stick."
196,2017,Wyatt Kalynuk,"Lanky defender who has great poise and vision, but his biggest strength is his all compass skating ability which allows him to explode on defenders, pivot on a dime and crossover as effortlessly as most skaters go forward. Glides laterally on the blueline to wait for a shooting lane to open.   Committed to Western Michigan University."
191,2017,Jocktan Chainey,"Big solid “Q” defender who is a solid, well-balanced skater who logs big minutes in both ends of the ice, due to his good hockey head and positioning. Not flashy, and probably would be even better if he was a tad quicker and a bit edgier. Needs to use his body more to handle attackers, but overall projects to a mid line-up rearguard if he continues to develop his game."
189,2017,Ben Jones,"Elusive skater with nice edging, soft, quick hands, and an active stick who gets under the skin of the opposition in the attack zone. Has the size but hasn’t develop a toolbox or much on-ice IQ at this juncture."
204,2017,Daniel Bukac,"The transition to the smaller North American ice stunted his early growth, but his high hockey IQ and effective puck movement has elevated his status from earlier in the season. Is a highly accomplished skater for a man his size, and his long stride gets him to the puck rapidly. He has adjusted, calmed, and plays like he is looking to where his next option is without the hesitations from early on. Gets his long stick in the passing lanes and breaks up plays. He’s a long strider who will improve his feet as he grows into his humongous body. A long term developmental project who need to get stronger and quicken his pace."
193,2017,Brady Gilmour,"Doug’s second son eligible for drafting. He is undersized and a lightweight, but very active and involved on the ice. Has good vision and smarts; need time to develop."
194,2017,Dylan Ferguson,"Was actually give the top ‘tender position while #1 Connor Ingram was away at World Juniors and showed he seemed capable of being the starter with many 40 plus save games and an impressive 6-3-1 record -- even keeping Ingram on the bench after his return from the WJ tourney. He displays good cross-crease movement, rebound control, quick reflexes, an excellent glove hand and nice puck tracking ability."
187,2017,Nicky Leivermann,Committed to the University  of Notre Dame.
185,2017,Alexander Sasha Chmelevski,"Los Angeles born Russian centre who simply can fly.  Oozes with skill, multiple gears, and good instincts for reading the ice. He is both a playmaker and a natural scorer, who seems smart and fearless in traffic. Changes directions and anticipates where to be and has good puck control. Ccan start an offensive look from a simple pass, dangle through the trash, and hide his release while shooting on the fly. Dangerous at even strength and on the power play. He gets in position for rebounds and quickly sets teammates up when his look closes down."
176,2017,Pavel Koltygin,"Left winger with good offensive instincts, size and hands. Despite not being a great skater, he finds open ice and can let the puck go. Has a strong release on his wrister. Really didn’t get any support, because he played for a less than stellar QMJHL team. Doesn’t have any edge or physicality but is tough enough to take the hit to make the play. Is an very good stickhandler and beats defenders in the attack zone. Has improved his play aways from the puck but he needs to continue to improve his consistency and awareness in the defensive zone."
177,2017,Skyler Brind'Amour,Committed to Michigan State University.
174,2017,Morgan Barron,"Big centre-forward with good size, strength and feet. Has a heavy shot. The issue is he doesn’t seem to see the ice well, read what’s happening, or show he has the hands to be more than a one man show. His linemates never see creative passes and looks on his part. This St. Andrews Aurora, Ontario student who has committed to Cornell University."
183,2017,Jordan Hollett,"Another huge goaler who continues to show upside in his first year of eligibility. Displays a wide stance, advanced footwork, and also is able to spread in the butterfly and still cover the top corners."
171,2017,D ' Artagnan Joly,Excellent skating big winger who handles the biscuit well while in flight and has some creativity in the offensive zone. His draft status is hampered by the fact he plays for a weaker team in the “Q.” Plays strong for sixty minutes but is in need of a quality centreman to compliment his game. A creative offensive mind who puts pucks to the correct areas and right players even though they fail to visualize the attack as well as he does. Displays a hard quick shot.
165,2017,Arnaud Durandeau,"Under six footer who has great wheels, edging, acceleration, and hockey awareness in his shifts as a Q rookie. Finds open ice and wins puck battles in the battle zones and greasy areas. Not the biggest guy or frame. Display a good shot that he should use more.  Not that big but has a clear willingness to fight for pucks all over the sheet."
163,2017,Brett Davis,"Versatile forward capable of playing all three forward positions. Has shown toughness, and some touch, but he has been erratic."
159,2017,Jacob McGrew,"Not yet six foot but a dynamic weapon with a tremendous shot, great instincts and great speed. Dominant in his puck possessions as he controls the tempo and flows with his elite passing ability and off the charts hand eye coordination. Needs time to add strength. Injuries marred his season."
154,2017,Tomas Vomacka,"Long-term developmental goalie prospect from Czech who is playing in the NAHL. Tall and thin and still needing more on his feet, positioning and over-all play."
148,2017,Kale Howarth,Committed to Northern Michigan.
146,2017,Kirill Maksimov,"Raw Russian import with great wheels and after-burners. Undersided and in need of more muscle, he is a long term developmental guy who needs meat to anchor him."
142,2017,Jonathan Jack Dugan,Committed to Providence College.
139,2017,Sebastian Aho,Undersized defender with good wheels and passing ability.
149,2017,Jarret Tyszka,"Plays on a deep Seattle blue line with a steady, non-flashy game with good positioning. Takes the body and takes care of his end first and foremost. Displays an active stick in the lateral passing lanes and, in most phases, is rarely out of position. Makes the first pass out in transition for his team, and can stick with his check, using the body to separate them from the puck. Very calm and collected, he clears the front of his net. Only an average skater at this point, he needs to improve in that aspect. Adding more edge would increase his success to move up the ranks to the higher pro levels."
133,2017,Tyler Inamoto,"big character defender who plays well both ways but whose strength is in his grit and his ability to handle puck retrievals and make clean outlets in transition. He has good mobility and can be a punisher in his end. His overall attack zone skills aren’t overly evident, but he isn’t out of his comfort zone if given some PP time. Committed to the University of Wisconsin"
138,2017,Drake Rymsha,"Has good size and scoring abilities, but needs more time to build his strength and all-around game. Long term development prospect."
126,2017,Michael Karow,"Sleeper pick who is a bigger defender with a solid anchor down low and plays a fairly rugged game. He projects as more of defensive defender who punishes attackers once they enter the defensive zone. He is committed to Boston College, where he will continue to improve in all phases."
122,2017,Kyle Olson,"Skinny, undersized skating defenseman who has a non-stop motor and is patient with the puck on the attack -- and an err of fearlessness. Smart and patient on the attack, he waits for the defenders to commit and then chooses his best option. A non-stop lightweight who will need time to gain strength and girth."
127,2017,Lukas Elvenes,"Power play producing centre-wing who has terrific hands in the tight spaces and around the net. Creative with a quick stick, fast soft hands and good anticipation. A natural goal scorer, with great control at top speed. Can separate when going North-South and quickly go laterally East-West when it's man to man. Can place the puck to the other side with the cross-ice pass with accuracy. Good on the give and go. Has top end acceleration and great first step. Needs to use his feet as a means to grow into a 200 player. And he needs to get thicker and stronger. There is no denying he is usually the most skilled guy on the sheet. Needs to sue his gifts as a 200 foot player who hustles shift after shift."
128,2017,Tyler Steenbergen,"Top point getter in the WHL is a second year eligible he has to be consider one of the top dozen snipers in the class, and he seems to have added a step or so to his stride this season. He may not project as even a top three line pro, but certainly has skills and attributes to be though of as a solid pro who competes for minutes on the bottom end of a roster and help increase a team’s depth in competition to fill a roster."
137,2017,Noah Cates,"Raw, high school forward whose grown substantially in the last year on and off the ice. Hockey smarts and a strong competitor, this Minnesota high schooler has made considerable impact in his games this season. Is thin but a very agile skater who needs to improve his jump. There's lots to like as he is nowhere close to a completed canvass. Committed to Boston College."
123,2017,Brandon Crawley,"Second year eligible New Jersey native who is a defense-first backliner. Solid in his own end and able to make plays on the offensive side, he has continued to improve with the Knights."
118,2017,Markus Phillips,"Quick, mobile defender, who generates plenty of offense from the back end. A quick passer, but even quicker with his one the dime turns."
120,2017,Tobias Geisser,"A big mobile Swiss defender with smarts tools and a toolbox, a strong understanding of the game, and nice stickhandling savvy. Can he continue to improve his play to handle the quicker play and pressure the big leagues bring? He only has one gear: faster than average. Needs plenty of time to fill out and continue improving his skills."
115,2017,Ostap Safin,"Huge winger who looks the part. Good skater, with solid straight line speed and powerful strides. Good hands and a powerful, heavy writ shot that handcuffs goalers -- especially since he lets it fly from all different angles. Good at handling the puck, or in the cycle, but for such a large guy, he simple is far too soft on the puck and needs to man up and play to his size especially when his team falls behind."
108,2017,Noel Hoefenmayer,"Long term defensive prospect who needs to play with more effort, passion, and better overall. Has trouble in his own end in most phases. Needs lots of time and tutelage to improve his all-around game."
116,2017,Bryce Misley,Committed to the University of vermont.
110,2017,Ian Scott,"Big goaler with very good hand-eye coordination, strong fundamentals and technique. Moves well for such a young prospect whose been asked to shoulder the load of a young midlevel WHL team. Well balanced with long arms. Keeps his hands above pad level and has the size to take away the top of the net while shuffling side to side cross crease on his knees with pads on the ice. Keeps his shoulder square to shooters. Cuts down angles, and uses his stick to cover the five hole and redirect pucks into the corners. Excellent prospect."
106,2017,Matthew Strome,"Will be the third brother drafted in the Strome family, but a bit of a different type of player than his more skilled older kin. He isn't as polished a skater as his brothers but makes up for it with a much more physical style of play, using his big body to create scoring chances, working the corners. He does possess a quick release, and displays patience in his carries. Displays high end hockey IQ, and gets to the front and scores. Very good in the cycle. The biggest deterrent to him being selected early is he has barely average foot speed and his pitiful off-the-mark acceleration. Needs to work on staying with his assignment in the defensive zone and not heading out before his team has established true possession. Today's NHL is a speed game, where even the big men are fleet afoot. Sure, with proper training and commitment, he will be able to improve in this area. The question is where in the slotting will a team make a selection of a player they know is in need of longer development and has a willingness to wait for him to come along?  In today's NHL, all twelve forwards skate and skate fast. They may be only 5' 8"" , but they aren't a defensive liability numbers-wise. That is the rub on brother number three."
112,2017,Tim Söderlund,"In someways, he is a Viktor Arvidsson type- Not all that tall,or as thick yet, but has an excellent straight line burst, and one of the faster guys in the class, and also a gritty forechecker who fearless unearths pucks and moves around the battle areas making good passes. He hasn't shown high-end passing skills but has goos hands and head in his carries, and makes plays. Needs plenty of time to get bigger & stronger."
107,2017,Maxim Sushko,Belarusian import with great hands and quick moves. He will change direction and beat defenders one on one. Terrific on the PP where he sets up at the half wall. He makes plays and will go to the front without hesitation.
109,2017,Adam Ruzicka,"Big centre-wing who can skate, move the puck and score. Soft hands and emerging physical tools, with good vision and execution. Giant centre who simply doesn’t seem to get what he needs to do to move upward and progress as a player. Gifted with the skills and size to be a dominant player, he seems to go through games without any hint of grittiness, or high compete level. Shows little creativity or intensity or involvement. Some team may call his name with the idea they can get him to develop."
102,2017,Scott Reedy,"Power wing on the US club, he started showing the ability to carry the puck, and make moves while in flight. Has the ability to make power moves down low, and work the cycle in deep. Can dominate physically if he wants, and displays a hard dangerous shot. Can throw big hits. He needs to keep his pins moving because that’s when he is the most effective. Teams will want to see his positives on more than a few occasions in games, and his goal will be to become that player. Committed to the University of Minnesota."
103,2017,Mikey Anderson,"Looked like the best defenseman in the USHL top Prospects game with solid tools and hockey sense. He plays an aggressive game in both ends, with good decisions and movement. Is a strong defender down low, and when going up ice, he is a no-hesitation carrier who handles the puck very well and with confidence. Not terrific in any aspect but solid in all areas. Committed to the University of Minnesota at Duluth."
100,2017,Malte Søstrup-Setkov,Absolutely huge Danish defender.who moves well in all directions for a large guy.  Teams will look at him as a developmental player who is physically active in the corners and wall and projects as a defensive defensive man who will progress as a carrier and attacker.
96,2017,Maksim Zhukov,"USHL import with good size, feet, glove, and agility. Still learning the position; needs to take a page out of the book of any newer NHL goaler: don't waste motions and start jumping around. Calmly hold your ground and let the play come to you."
98,2017,Nikita A. Popugayev,"The team that selects this huge Russian prospect will be doing so based on size and agility at his stature, and his over-all skill level. Able to quickly start and stop, and be a frightening presence. For a man of his size, his stick-handling is off the charts. He plays the puck close to his feet and pops up very quickly, getting maximum torque with shots and passes. His long stride gets him going quick so he can coast, looking like a jumbo jet about to take off. Plays strong on the stick and presents problems all over the attack zone as he turns quickly and then will cut back through the layers. Was traded and is leading his Prince George Cougar team with more than a point per game. All the signs point upward, although scoring a few more goals may seal the deal in the scout's minds."
95,2017,Jack Rathbone,"Undersized defender with good vision, high end skating ability and grit. Very elusive and uses his shiftiness to move pucks out of his zone and unto the attack, which he will hope in on. His low center of gravity gives him the ability to cannonball opponents and knock them off the puck and play.  It also enables him to bounce of contact in his carries. A longer term project that need to work on his decision making and getting faster all around."
105,2017,Santeri Virtanen,"Injured his shoulder after an excellent shown in the Ivan Glinka in August. A player who had shown fair amounts of sandpaper and grit, and strong play on the puck. Good size and room to add weight on his frame. He already carries defenders and is a mismatch when he parks himself in front. Provides a fine screen for outside shots and doesn't take time off, always trying to make things happen. Plays very physical, and good when he doesn't have the puck."
94,2017,Nicholas Henry,"A skilled first year forward formally of MJHL Championship Portage, where he helped them to their second straight league championship, and then came oh so close to playing in the RBC Cup – the national championship for junior A hockey. A sturdily built six footer clicked early with his veteran linemates. He is playmaker who likes to cycle the puck down low and has a good shot. Sees the ice well and is creative with the puck, generating scoring chances. Hard working and disciplined. A longer term development guy who will work to improve his top foot speed and all around game."
93,2017,Clayton Phillips,"Under six foot defenseman who is new at the position, making the transition from forward. Terrific four-direction skater who handles the puck well, has good feet, and stick skills. Committed to University of Minnesota."
92,2017,David Farrance,"Under six foot defender who is a mobile defenseman with terrific offensive skills and high end passing skills. Displays excellent vision and has the ability to throw the home run stretch pass to a teammate with accuracy. Very good on the power play at moving the puck to the right option. Quick and precise in retrieval in his end, and a power play generator who reads his passing options but also has a rocket from the point. Committed to Boston University"
91,2017,Jack Badini,Committed to Harvard University
90,2017,Evan Barratt,"A centreman with good hands, good vision and hockey IQ and high tempo motor. Plays a an energetic high tempo game with passion. Falls short in his skating and lateral agility, but he is committed to Penn State University, where he will build his body and improve his play."
87,2017,Cale Fleury,"Long term development player who seems to have flat lined and never started a developmental improvement climb from his horrendous plus minus numbers, and lack of defensive zone positioning. Little improvement of that short choppy stride he has. Combine that with blind passes and lack of toughness as a defender, teams will need to see more positives to think twice about using more than a very late grab bag pick to try and develop him."
97,2017,Mason Shaw,"Smaller late birthday winger who suffers from the fact he isn’t all that big. He possesses so many tools that might help him overcome his size limitations. Has a top end separation gear, and an excellent starting burst. A superb passer who threads the needle with the puck while on the move. Has finally had the luxury of a no-injury season, and he has now grown his game…one which sees him in perpetual motion, sustaining pressure and looking to ferret out rebounds."
82,2017,Cameron Crotty,"Committed to Boston University, where he will continue to work on his foot speed. Displays toughness, excellent functional strength and size. Needs to work on improving his foot speed and agility."
85,2017,Ivan Lodnia,"Fast, quick offensive generator who passes the puck while displaying high end skill and feet. Is brilliant when he has the puck; an elite passer who can pin-point pass the biscuit while is flight. What he lacks in size he uses his skill and hockey instincts to make up for. Super skilled creative player who has four knocks against him:  1. That he is a one-dimensional player, 2. That he doesn't play with sustained intensity for 60 minutes 3. that he's not committed defensively, and 4. He's an average skater lacking a top end gear. He lacks height but that doesn't get him off the hook to be a better forechecker, back-checker or a puck battler. And he may not be a blazer, but he moves awfully well laterally on the attack. Has a good shot and excellent passing ability. He will need to continue to add strength and two way game including better defensive zone commitment, but looks like a prospect with an offensive nose for the net, and a great feel for getting open offensively."
88,2017,Keith Petruzzelli,"Impressive big goaltender who has finally slowed down and learned to let his enormous size and gifts to do the work instead of getting in “fire drill mode.” Terrific combination of size and athletic ability that has NHL teams returning to make their final ranking decisions on him. Displays a strong glove hand and excellent awareness in his area. So big that when in his full spread, he covers the entire bottom while on his knees and still covers most of the top corners! Committed to Quinnipiac University."
84,2017,Dmitri Samorukov,"Thin six foot off side defender who can play cool and patient in his end, but also will start running around a bit. He is good at finding the transition breakouts, and was possibly the best Russian defender last August in the Ivan Hlinka Tournament. Projects as a major power play point man with an accurate shot from both the point and when he moves up into the slot area."
80,2017,Kirill Ustimenko,"Once the notice was out, this Russian goalie became one unheralded player teams are hoping to select before anyone else does. Terrific athlete with great agility and flexibility. Tracks well and never gives up on shots. Very thin and will need to add wieght to anchor him. A sleeper pick if there ever was one."
83,2017,Zachary Gallant,"Under-the-radar centre/forward who is a puck generator, scorer, and plays both on the power play and the penalty-kill. Solid forechecker and two way player who will drop the gloves if necessary too."
79,2017,Lane Zablocki,"Inconsistent centre who seems willing to let teammates do the heavy lifting, while he waits for a gift wrapped chance. Displays a quick shot and good jump in his skating, and scored 28 goals, but you are not sure from game to game if he is gonna work all 200 feet, or wait for teammates to make him."
86,2017,Daniil Tarasov,A knee injury took away the entire season from him after a promising showing last April at the U-18 Worlds.
76,2017,Alexy Lipanov,"Solid centreman with height but a need to get thicker. He is equally strong as he is an offensive generator or scorer. Very agile and quick, but also has great acceleration and sends opposition defenders to their heels as he blows by them on the attack. Creates chances for himself and linemates with his ability transition North-South in a hurry. In the 8 Nations Ivan Hlinka, he centred Russia’s top line between Chekhovich and Svechnikov."
78,2017,Stuart Skinner,"Big goaler with broad shoulders, long legs and a really wide stance. Has taken his game up a notch with less pre-shot ""dancing""-he now relaxes, tracks, and lets the play come to him. Not great on his skates and only shows decent movement and at this juncture, looks stiff and deep in the net. But his size enables him to stay upright and close much of the open net without much movement. Uses his stick well to clear pucks from passes in front and his size lets him get from side to side in one easy motion. Long term developmental guy with upside. Put himself into second round consideration with and incredible playoff for Lethbridge."
75,2017,Nate Schnarr,"Big Centre-forward with a pro heavy wrist shot. Still getting comfortable with his size, he looks gangly but has nice North-South speed. Has above average hands but isn’t an accomplished finisher. Has the tools and is a terrific competitor who gets in the passing lanes, blocks shots, and possesses a willingness to battle hard for the puck. He has a good skill level but needs time and coaching to round his game out into the sum of the parts."
77,2017,Ben Mirageas,"A long term project that struggled at times this season, but has the size and mobility that might develop over time. He can make the quick outlets in transition, and hustles back into his end to retrieve pucks. At times seems to be lack in vision and overall hockey sense, especially when he feels the pressure closing down on him. Committed to Providence College."
73,2017,Stelio Mattheos,"An offensive star in the lower tiers, he is trying to turn himself into more of a power forward. Displays a great shot but his goals come around the goal where he pounces on rebounds. He is a good player in traffic, and can battle past contact with the puck on his stick. A decent wall player who extends possessions with physicality. Can put the power move on defenders using his shoulder to get wide and around defenders. The hope teams will have is that he rebuilds his scoring prowess from the lower tiers and is able to round out to an all-around threat in the attack zone."
71,2017,Kasper Kotkansalo,"Big mobile defender who had an entire year of injuries that hampered his growth and confidence. He has soft hands to make those tricky saucer passes, and sees the cross-ice feeds in the attack zone. He use the toe drag to freeze defenders, opening space on the power play. Exits his defensive zone on carries and forcefully enters the attack zone. Has lots of jam and knocks opponents off the puck, closes down hard on the wall, and ties up attackers in front --"
69,2017,MacKenzie Entwistle,"A fundamentally sound player with excellent skating ability and great size. He is never going to put up large scoring numbers, but is a guy who makes your team better and helps you win. A North-South skater with powerful stride and very good acceleration. He gets many shots on net when he gets possession. Strong in both ends and may get better in all areas as he develops."
67,2017,Morgan Geekie,"Second year eligible who has elevated game, his confidence, and his grittiness. Gives 60 minutes of effectiveness as a smart defensive centre, and top face-off man. Good on the PP and always able to get to open seams in hopes he can be passed the puck to let loose his big time shot."
68,2017,Scott Walford,Suffered a lower body injury in the playoffs that made him unavailable for future opportunities playing in The Under-18 Worlds or for Team Canada. Was made an assistant captain.
66,2017,Max Gildon,"Big defender with a heavy one-timer, which acts a large part of his team’s power play. Is very agile and a four direction skater with good balance for a big man. A developmental work in progress and needs work on his defensive-zone coverage, positioning, and to get that big cannon to hit the net. Is progressing as an active puck carrier who was able to move down low with his touches."
64,2017,Michael DiPietro,"One of the riskiest decisions in the draft is surrounded around him due to the fact he is only six foot although he is a first rounder prospect in terms of his on ice play. Has great flexibility and spring to his down-to-up movement. Handles the puck with the best of them. Has soft pads to soak up shots and reduce rebounds, and stays square to shooters making them have to be perfect in their attempts. Tracks the puck really well, and quickly goes cross-crease with excellent push form post to post. A competitor with strong focus who gobbles up rebounds, and if he can’t stay with the puck, he can stop the second attempt. You have to wonder in the era of where teams think having a  giant “statue” goaltender who is a big plug will be a deterrent form goals being scored, when will a guy this talented get picked, or even iF he does."
65,2017,Jonas Røndbjerg,"Danish winger with a nice combination of size and skill. Has a powerful stride, good acceleration, creativity, skill, and grit. Is good at bringing the puck in on the attack, and has good patience when he finally sets up his linemates. Displays soft hands and patience in his carries. A scoring centre who also can line up as a winger. He has a wide skating base, long stride, and balance, which will help take defenders both inside and to the outside, pushing the pace on the attack. Has a good hockey head, but is not the finished product. Displays a hard wrister and patience in the attack zone. Will take some time, but might play."
58,2017,Joni Ikonen,Smaller player who displays good offensive ability and puck skill. Seems to see himself as the best first option to shoot on most of his carries. Needs to use his teammates more as options instead of hogging the puck.
57,2017,Ian Mitchell,"Undersized “push” defenseman with a solid understanding in the defensive zone. This is a player who is woefully underdeveloped physically, and one who will need time to become naturally accustomed to playing his position without hesitation or thinking. His skating and passing ability is high-end; excellent passer who easily QBs the attack from the top. Plays hard on the puck with his carries in, and has a terrific touch with his set-ups. Can pass while in a backward stride and displays a precise wrist shot from the point. Needs more development to get stronger and add the muscle to aid him in front and when in contact situations with attacking players in his end. He has committed to Denver University where he will be tutored at his position as he does grow stronger."
61,2017,Grant Mismash,"Has considerable tools and gifts that put him in a position to be a solid pro someday, but so far lacks commitment and on-ice intensity to grow more of his game."
59,2017,Eemeli Räsänen,"Big body whose size at this juncture can work against him when he is not moving his feet or read the ensuing attack. Capable of nice plays with his D to D passes, but his vision and hockey IQ still is not where it should be. Combine that with feet that are slow to adjust to the change in attack and looks that make him become uncomfortable and prone to turnovers. Uses his size along the wall and is a good character kid. He is a developmental prospect who needs to work on his turns, agility, and improving in all phases, but does project as an interesting prospect long term."
62,2017,Jake Leschyshyn,"Chippy son of former NHLer, Curtis, is an irritating forechecker and disrupter in all three zones. Projects as a future energy player in the bigs if he continues to improve his agility, crisp edging, and lateral explosiveness. Has excellent hand-eye coordination, picks pucks out of the air, and turns them into possessions. He effectively tips in his teammates shots when he sets up as a screen in the paint area in front. Is a great counter player from the middle zone. Has lateral explosion and holds the puck until the opposition starts to close down on him; then his pass will find it’s target while he is in mid-flight. His lateral movement skill and feet are used in his efforts behind the goal line, throwing the defenders in a tizzy with his carries. Make no mistake though; he earns future paycheck with his second efforts in front by creating traffic and his puck battle wins there and in other battle zones."
60,2017,Antoine Morand,Quick hands and ability to pounce of rebounds. More of an opportunistic sniper who skates lurking in the perimeters and swoops in to get that quick strike chance. Needs to play stronger on the puck and add strength to his anchor.
54,2017,Ukko-Pekka Luukkonen,"Big Finnish goalie who plays with quickness, mobility, recovery speed, and post-to-post agility. He had the luxury of playing in front of an awfully good HPK team that limits his shot totals to in the low twenties. His size leaves little open space between the goal-opening. Plays with composure and is good at handling the puck. Vey competitive and strong down low."
52,2017,Luke Martin,"Thick, stay at home defender who is now a Freshman at the University of Michigan. Has shown an uptick in his agility and footwork, but continues to be a player who has to work a bit of physicality into every match he plays. If he can, he will body attackers off the puck in this area. Is steady in his own end and makes a crisp breakout pass in transition. Handles the opposition forecheck pretty well. He hasn't displayed much offensive creativity, but like so many players in this class, they are going to need developmental time and could make leaps in improvement."
50,2017,Maxime Comtois,"The Châteauguay Grenadiers graduate is the surprise door prize that will fall to a team not picking first but in the high pick area. Scouts will be be able to cite what he doesn't have, but he has a long list of strengths that translate to the pro game that are already blossoming. He is an absolute force and can line up anywhere in the forward position and dominate with intimidating big league hits. Plays heavy and punishes. Very on-ice smart and has terrific straight line speed. His speed can make him elusive in his carries, but his size also allows him to bull his way to chances, as he sees the ice well. Handles the puck at a high pace and has a great one-timer. Can move at his top end speed and handle the puck with quick hands and also has a hard wrist snapper. Good hands and good on the cycle, he is a two way player with little risk, because he plays for you as a dominant wing, and may just be a high end all around performer."
47,2017,Alex Formenton,"World class skater who is feather light but has a strong nose for the back of the net. Displays average hands, but with time, he may come around and add improved stick work to his elite speed and the hint of grit and toughness. A hard worker who some teams may choose as a long developmental player -- and be rewarded."
56,2017,Josh Brook,"His fluidness and light edging are what starts the conversation projecting him as an eventually pro defender. He has on-ice tools and a two-way game, but he still is learning to put his game together, making the right decisions, and getting to where he is operating more on instinct with his movements -- just not there yet. But there is much to like that projects him as a pro defenseman. Even if he fails to reach his upside, some team may end up with a solid five or six for many a season."
48,2017,Alexander Volkov,"Promising winger with exceptional feet, hands and puck skills. Really smart on the attack but is a long term developmental guy who needs time to improve his overall team game and defensive zone commitment."
55,2017,Jonah Gadjovich,"Chippy two way winger with offensive skills and good size to impact games. Gives a strong sixty minute effort of solid positional play and effort. Not the fastest guy, but he makes sure he gives effort in his back check and other areas in the defensive zone. Surprised with a solid offensive performance of 46 goals."
45,2017,Alexandre Texier,"French born centreman who was France’s best player in the Division One World Juniors despite being the team’s youngest member. Displayed excellent poise, vision, and hockey sense to go with his heavy accurate shot, crisp passes, and a high tempo motor. Has a bow-legged stride, but is well-balanced and is light in his edging and a threat to score with each shift. Played on France’s top line and ran the power play from the half wall. Looks like Philippe Bozon may have a successor."
44,2017,Filip Westerlund,"Undersized blue liner who displays a high confidence level in his carries and accurate passing ability. Terrific, well-balanced skater who can hurdle out of his end in breakouts, with excellent hands and hockey IQ. May be accused of trying to do to much solo. He needs the benefit of more time to develop both game wise and physically, as he still can be a detriment in corner play and in front."
46,2017,Robin Salo,"Finnish defender with prototypical size, who plays a solid and steady game with good positioning, good reads, and a quick stick. At this juncture, he  doesn’t project as impact up ice offensive performer, but has many tools that are on an uptick. He is a solid stickhandler and can handle the reception of hard passes even on the fly.  Doesn’t rush in his end when the puck comes to him for its trek back to the offensive side; he will start moving his feet before trying to rush it off his stick if there is the time to start moving out. He then finds the best outlet into the attack zone. Has upside with time."
49,2017,Mario Ferraro,"Undersized two-way defender who is an excellent skater with high end hockey sense, vision, and competitiveness. Plays physical like he is a much bigger guy, and doesn’t see each puck battle as one that he is at a disadvantage. Is so good with his quickness, decisions, and direction change because of his good edging, quickness, and pivots. Reads his own end well and when there are no safe options, he simply carries it out. He really needs to work on his shot as he is no threat to score with it until he gains strength all around. Committed to the UMass (Amherst)."
53,2017,Jack Studnicka,"Lean two way centreman who leads by example with grit, giddy-up, and great team first gumption. His quick feet get him going and he deceptive slides into open seams looking for the puck. Well schooled and solid in his own end, and is calm and smart during the heat of the play. An unselfish player who will work passing plays from all the areas in front and work the wall and around the horn to unearth pucks too. Although he thinks pass first, he has a been know to surprise with well placed shots while off balance, but was probably looked at as a bottom end centre with his contributions being his strengths and not as a player who would be counted on to score…until he suddenly came on in the playoffs and also with Team Canada at the World U-18s, contributing at a higher rate than anyone had seen until that point. Needs time to develop, and he isn’t a sure thing, but the scoring may improve. He has some skills and good feet, and comes to play a responsible way for 60 minutes, so that makes him a safer selection, albeit one that may not have a high water mark. I see lots of guys making a living in the bigs who fit that very same description."
40,2017,Aleksi Heponiemi,"Smart undersized centre-forward with figure skater like control in his dashes and darts. A wizard with the puck due to his edge control, he can make the correct cut out of trouble. He utilizes his ability as a precise touch-passer to control which option he is going to with the biscuit. Defenders tend to back off out of respect for his ability camouflage his passes. He's constantly in motion, and eludes contact, slipping through coverage. High hockey IQ player who looks off coverage and blindly hits his intended target with the puck. He positions his small frame to protect himself and the puck and sometimes seems impossible to hit. Stops on a dime. Wins with a quick head, feet, and hands."
41,2017,Jaret Anderson-Dolan,"Undersized player who has the potential to blossom into a true scorer. Very young, but already displays understanding and very good hockey sense and continuing improvement as a 200-foot player. Maybe because some see him as the beneficiary of Kailer Yamamoto's offensive generations, he wasn't even asked to participate in the CHL Top Prospects Game. A good shooter who can accurately hit the upper corners, he fearlessly shoots from unsuspecting positions and angles. Is a player who wants the puck to make things happen, and is driven to forecheck and chase the enemy participants who have it. This five foot ten dynamo is one of the younger players in the draft. An intense forechecker and hard working attacker who seems to be able to hit the top corners of the net from even the most impossible angles. His quick stop/starts push back defenders and give him time and space. Granted, he has had the luxury of playing along side Kailer Yamamoto, but he has earned his way on his line with very strong work ethic, and a reliable 200 foot game. Has terrific acceleration and is light on his edges. Somewhere down the line he has the potential to add true pro scorer next to his mantle as a intense forechecker and defensively aware all-around player. A strong up-and-down worker who has continually improved his defensive awareness as the season progressed. He will be off the board very early on day two of the draft, if he doesn't hear his name called on day one."
38,2017,Gustav Lindström,"An aggressive, 2-way defenseman with great passing and scoring instincts. Most notable for his 4-goal, 5-assist performance in a single game for Almunta in U16s. Since then, he's continued to put up great offensive numbers, including 7 points in 4 games for his country internationally. He struggled a little in his first season with Sweden's second-tier league (Allsvenskan), particularly in his play without the puck and defending larger forwards. He still managed to finish 2nd in scoring among U19 defenders. There's skill here, but he needs time to develop his puck handling and fill out his frame."
36,2017,Jesper Boqvist,"Lightweight, elusivr Swedish winger with great hands and feet. A change-of-pace skater with great balance and ability to change directions. There is a need for him to get stronger and thicker so he doesn’t get knocked off the puck in skirmishes. Displays a high work ethic and the ability to score in so many different ways; he can score with his one-timer in the circles, use his hand-eye coordination and deflect/tip shots, snatching rebounds in front or off the rush."
35,2017,Isaac Ratcliffe,"A man among boys who displays the raw tools to develop into a NHL power forward. Tough forechecker and good feet for a big man, he has toughness, an active stick, and a good release. Goes to the front without hesitation and is good on the cycle. His size causes problems for the opposition. He displays good hands and when he adds some leg strength he may be even more difficult to contend with."
34,2017,Nicolas Hague,"Potential big defender in more ways than one. NHL teams continue to have their love affair with huge men at the defensive position who have upside to be top four defenders, since in general the Dmen are getting smaller. For a fellow his size, he has excellent mobility and overall strength. He puts his long stick in the passing lanes and covers ground pretty quickly. Uses his size along the wall and can throw devastating bodychecks. When on the back pedal, he doesn't pivot as quickly as smaller men, but attackers trying to go wide find out how strong he is and how long his stick is. Enjoys playing with an edge. He is growing more of his offensive game, by activating on the rush, and attempting to handle the puck more and more. Still needs work and must hone his carries and be more frugal in the time he holds onto it. Not a finished product, but there will not be a shortage of NHL teams considering him before the bottom third of the first round."
32,2017,Conor Timmins,"Promising defense prospect who seems cool and collected in most on-ice situations. Sees, thinks, and reacts at a high level with his passes and attack strategies. A smooth skater and puck-handler who is very smart with where he directs it. Has a great touch and leads his teammates to where his pass is going. Can make the hard-up-ice blueline break-in from the neutral zone, or with sweet saucer passes from both sides of his stick."
43,2017,Dylan Samberg,"Minnesota native winner of the Reed Larson award for the state’s best HS senior defenseman in the state. He uses his pro size to play a robust full 200ft game, including finishing on bone-rattling hits. Very strong and mobile, he is well-rounded in all phases and a nice toolbox of skills with room to add more muscle to his frame. He finished the season as a member of the Waterloo USHL team where he will return next year before fulfilling his commitment to the University of Minnesota at Duluth."
33,2017,Kole Lind,"Sleeper pick in the first. He is one of the best goal scorers in the class, but at this juncture is a lightweight who is tall but thin. Has the frame to carry more girth and may grow an inch or two. Has an excellent wrist snapper he gets off quickly and a booming slapper. He is a really strong skater with good balance and displays good edging that helps him turn abruptly to elude defenders. He isn't afraid to protect himself when he plants himself near the blue paint. A strong skater and very good with his zone entries on the carry in. Really has a good hockey sense and quickly advances the biscuit to create good looks. Seems to capitalize whenever he is able to get loose and get open. He is also a good playmaker and stays involved on the attack. He is at his best when he plays with grit and edge, and his play is trending that way. Has really progressed in his WHL career, but still hasn't reached the 45 goals/79 points in 44 games totals he had in Saskatoon midget, but as he gets bigger and stronger, he may just develop into an NHL power scorer."
31,2017,Klim Kostin,Big man with good balance who is strong on his pins and difficult to move off the puck. Has a decent shot to go with very good stick skills.  Goes hard to the front of the net. Fearless and always willing to take punishment and not back off from returning some. He might be a better player if he didn't have such a pass-first mentality. Suffered a shoulder injury that will shut him down the rest of the season.
37,2017,Marcus Davidsson,"High tempo Swedish centre-forward with excellent speed, lateral agility, and acceleration. Seems to be very active and involved in all three zones. Strong puck pursuit player who pressures to take the puck back, and very fast and elusive in battle areas and tight places when on the attack. Displays a quick release and strong one-timer. Still hasn't shown a dominant offensive game, but has a great first-step burst and a low centre of gravity. He is difficult to stop or take the puck away from. Always moving and an excellent back-checker with an excellent commitment in his own end."
27,2017,Morgan Frost,"200 foot centreman who needs a bit more girth, but he comes to play every game every shift, in all three zones. Really hockey smart, steady, and  instinctive in his own end. Despite not being the biggest guy, he will sacrifice his body to clear the defensive zone, or to try and get pucks in the attack zone.  A smart playmaker with a strong work ethic, good hands, and an obsession to get the loose pucks."
39,2017,Jason Robertson,"Big left winger with size, speed, a great shot, and  on-ice intelligence. One of his team's leaders. There are thoughts that his game is hampered by his team lacking a top centre to play off of. He still manages to use his quick wrist shot to score on his own, and he is able to create chances for teammates through his stellar work in the attack zone. He Is a powerful skater with good drive, balance, and acceleration. I have heard the constant criticism of his foot speed, but he gets there and is smart enough to do all the work on scoring plays without it being a huge deterent; he lacks a true first step, but no one can convince me his feet hold hIm back in the NHL, and as he improves them, you don't wait for all the rest of the parts of his game to develop...he has lots there already.  He has a terrific release and drives into the slot area, protecting the puck before he shoots or passes it. Very good board player and defensively responsible."
28,2017,Shane Bowers,"Highly skilled two way centre that plays a mature 200 game. Has an exceptional hockey IQ and good feet and head. He will slip through the defensive layers to the soft areas and use his quick release to score. He likes the puck on his stick and is a very good passer who is easy for his linemates to follow. He shined at the USHL West Showcase. Still thin, but has room to fill out. The big question is whether scouts and teams see him as a a true NHL second liner or simply with the upside to be a solid 3rd line centre-forward. That, more than anything else, will determine he his name gets called. A very safe pick as the chances are very probable he plays in the league in some capacity."
30,2017,Eeli Tolvanen,"He is not yet six foot but hard not to notice in every game he plays. A natural offensive generator and scorer who uses his acceleration, quick bursts and a quick stick. Has a NHL shot which he gets off quickly and he needs little space to place deadly accurate spots in the back of the net. Needs to round out his game and get bigger and stronger, but he is a natural scorer with a lightning release and great jump to get to open spaces in the attack zone. Elite shooter with a strong stick which will get pucks away from the opposition. Is determined to improve his defensive game and over-all play. The elite rifle is already in the tool cabinet."
26,2017,Jake Oettinger,"The BU Freshman goaltender has upped his draft status with a solid season and continued improvement with his calm and athletic game that features solid mechanics, good reads, and fluid crease movements. Tracks the puck well, and is poised and ready in his recovery to make the second save on the second shot. Has good anticipation and has been a keystone in some of his team’s wins."
29,2017,Henri Jokiharju,"Not big or thick, but prototypical in style to the new age defenseman who has good feet, stick, and high skill in playing the game at the fastest pace. Not a punishing physical defender, but one who wins races to the puck, anticipate plays, legally tie attackers up, and always has his stick and body positioned on the right side of the puck carrier. Blessed with great balance and quick feet, he is superb puck mover who advances the biscuit with sharpness and accuracy. Smart with or without the puck, he makes quick decisions and always places it, in the correct spot at the right time when advancing it. Makes the long stretch pass out of the zone and on the power play, he shows great vision in his puck distribution."
25,2017,Ryan Poehling,"Strong skating centre-wing who is very strong on his skates and very difficult to contain. Has size and scoring ability to go along with his good feet. Displays a hard, accurate shot. He plays in all situations including the PK & PP. Is willing and able to carry the biscuit out of his own end in transition. Will get stronger and heavier. Will be close to NHL ready sooner than most of his class."
23,2017,Pierre-Olivier Joseph,"A qualitative jump in his all around play has hurtled him upward into the first round discussions. A player who always looked solid as an improving defender but who this season has gained scads of confidence in his ability to be a key component in the attack. Displays mobility and excellent hockey sense, and has that feel for where play is going before it does. Breaks up rushes and plays in his end with a good stick and strong recognition. A power play quarterback whose frame will allow him to get bigger and as he gets stronger, he will add more mustard to the heat he can bring from the point. His brother, Mathieu, was a Tampa Bay draft pick."
21,2017,Filip Chytil,"Big, edgy centre with good, soft hands, puck skills, and foot speed and is smart in his carries. May end up on the wing."
24,2017,Kristian Vesalainen,"Excellent combination of skill, size, and shot.  Reads and reacts to situations in the attack zone well and is strong on the puck. His quickness allows him to separate the opposition from the puck. Strong quick release. Can play either side and displays power and speed. He closes on defenders with his top burst of speed and they are unprepared for him, which leads to penalties or he will blow straight by them. He makes things look easy, like he is a veteran player, reading the ice so well, making terrific give and go passes, with power and agility in his handling of the biscuit. Terrific finisher with a heavy shot. Looks like a top ten selection at this juncture. Already being touted as ""Jesse Puljujärvi lite,"" there are a lot of similarities, but Vesalainen still has a ways to go."
20,2017,Robert Thomas,"Good all around centre who plays at a high tempo with creativity. Good decision maker and playmaker with excellent stick-handling ability. Moves well laterally, and has plenty of juice to spin, shoot, or pass when he sees an attack opening. Not a scorer, but is good at getting the puck to the scorers he plays alongside."
19,2017,Josh Norris,"Rangy centreman with a long stride who projects as a physical two-way centreman. Strong on the wall, battle areas, and in one on one battles. Good in the dot. Works well down low. Always goes full tilt, never quitting. Will throw pucks at the net from anywhere and then proceed to shake things up looking to retrieve it. Does not have tricky stickhandle moves or slick skating moves, but projects as a pro centre. Committed to the University of Michigan."
22,2017,Kailer Yamamoto,"Another small guy who seems to instantly make any linemates better due to his fabulous playmaking ability and smarts. Will stick his nose and contribute mightily in all three zones. A terrific skater with lateral mobility and explosiveness. Displays excellent vision and competitiveness. Darts into the open areas or flies into the battle areas snatching loose pucks and capitalizing. Equally dangerous as a scorer or set up man. His connection to the NHL is fellow Washington State native Tyler Johnson's mother, who taught him how to skate."
15,2017,Erik Brännström,"One of the younger draft eligible defensemen in the class, he is a terrific skater with plenty of offensive skill and a good enough stick to get things done in his own end. He will have to get thicker and more muscle but has great feet and hockey IQ, so don't count him out as a player just because he hasn't matured completely. Quick on ice thinker who is an excellent stickhandler to blend with his quick feet and shiftiness. Aggressive powerplay point man with a big time wrist shot, and moves the puck quickly and efficiently on the man advantage. At times was a one man show in the Five Nations Tourney, where he gained the zone easily and fly with the bisquit on his blade."
18,2017,Urho Vaakanainen,"A year or so back, he was considered one of the Finnish jewels of this class, but there is some doubt as to whether he truly projects as a top four NHL player: he is of only average size,  has little ruggedness, or few abilities that project him as a stay at home defender. He skates well and has some up-ice skill, but hasn’t grown into a top offensive defenseman at this juncture."
16,2017,Juuso Välimäki,"Smart mobile defenseman with excellent feet and feel for the defensive zone. captained the Finnish U-18 team vocally displays his high hockey IQ, keeping his teammates on task. Besides prototypical size, he great puck handling skills to go along with his agility. This season, he has boasted his offensive totals considerably. That would be a signal that he is improving at the offensive end. He even had a hat trick this season against Vancouver in the WHL. He is not a riverboat gambling rocket out of his own end leading the rush type player. On the contrary, he seems to always be the last one out of his end because he plays such a solid and safe defensive game. You will see him make a tape to tape outlet passes in transition, but rarely leads the throops out.  He will activate and calmly keep it until he is all the way down low.  He will have to continue to get more handles and more time with the puck, to gain more confidence as an offensive generator. It is hard to argue against his point a game pace in the Dub, but he still has to develop a bit more instinct as a confident attacker at the higher levels. It seems a bit harsh on my part to be asking for more, even though I have him on the cusp of the first half of the first round, but there is untapped potential there. Not overly physical, but clears out the front uses his size well down low. Has a big frame that can get bigger. Great vision, puck-handling and accurate will be the bonuses that will come along with his safe, consistent mistake free play play in his own end."
14,2017,Callan Foote,"Big defenseman with a big point shot. Not necessarily a polished puck carrier, but is surprisingly agile going East-West. He is excellent in his own end to cover attackers and space. Uses his size to win wall and battle zone possessions and will clear the front. No mean streak, but is a really solid competitor for 60 minutes. Plays on both the penalty kill and the power play. Excellent hockey sense and reads his own end well. Stays square on rushers and takes them outside, using his stick to take away their time and space. Very good on his feet and light on his edging, and able to play strong on the puck. Has a good low shot that he places on the net. Needs to fill out and get stronger. The Kelowna system has developed many NHL defenders so he seems in a good position to improve and get selected fairly early. Great bloodlines with his father Adam Foote."
17,2017,Timothy Liljegren,"Started the year ranked as a top defenseman prospect based on smooth and mature play from the back end as a puck mover, attacker and PP man, Thick not large, but there is little on the negative side on how well he uses his abilities to defend. A world class skater who has agility mobility and great acceleration, he displays high hockey IQ and reads the ice as well as any NHL defender. Already in the Swedish Elite league and not at all out of place. He really hasn't gotten any bigger or physically stronger, and that might have him sliding down draft lists from top defenseman in the class to maybe a risky selection early on. He is a strong puck mover who will fearlessly lead the attack as a newbie in the SHL. If he does slide, he may make one NHL team's scouting staff look like geniuses."
13,2017,Nick Suzuki,"One of the most feared penalty-killers in the OHL, he never goes unnoticed every shift. An under six footer who is a puck magnet, and continually gets loose so his teammates have a scoring outlet.  Responsible defensively and has continued to hone his overall game. Small, but able to both score and set-up his linemates."
12,2017,Martin Necas,"An offense-generating centreman who creates looks by using his terrific speed to barrel through and deftly set up teammates. Has excellent vision and a nice tempo in his carries where he will dial up his pace and surprise  defenders. This playmaker will create separation for himself and change direction keep control, cut back sharply, and still be in possession. Uses his acceleration gears to lull defenders before he dashes away from them. More of a pass first attacker who might hold the biscuit a bit too much, but there is lots of upside to him. Hockey USA might have won the Five Nations tournament, but he tilted the ice and elevated himself an early selection maybe as high as fifth overall. Needs strength and girth, but showed no fear as he cut through to the dirty areas to create chances."
11,2017,Gabriel Vilardi,"Big solid centre-forward who can score. Has come back from injuries and was a top player in the World Junior U-17s. Displays a two-way game, great skills, and uses his body to make space. Best player in the OHL. Smart, strong on the puck and on the cycle. Makes terrific feeds to his teammates and dominates when pucks are in contention. Can come off the edge with truly strong power moves to the front. He has shown true goal scoring abilities and projects as, at the very least, a top six scorer if the trends continue to improve."
9,2017,Michael Rasmussen,"Large competitive two-way centreman with skill and good feet.  A gritty, naturally strong player with mobility who wins most board scrums. He is a dominant player in the front and below the goal line. A mobile skater who is difficult to contain or move; he wins puck battles and scores. Intriguing prospect with upside offensively: difficult to contain, and effective vision and passing skills. Owns the front of the net on the power play. He might look for the pass over shooting, but he protects the biscuit well. Has an upright skating stride but gets there and shows jam when he greets you. His combination of power and skill is at the high end of this draft class, even though you might hope he would show a bit more effort all sixty minutes. A raw talent who may end up being the best player out of the West."
10,2017,Owen Tippett,"Pure goal scoring speedster who is work in progress. He has size very good size, and girth, and besides the great speed, he can be a threat from anywhere inside the attack zone. Displays both a strong slapper and wrist shot. Will release the puck from what seems like low percentage angles and find the back of the net. Might have gained too much muscle and weight with the 18 pounds he added...it has reduced his pure foot speed a bit, but it does help in his puck possession battles. Needs to read the situations and hit the mark with his shots, not just let fly with reckless abandon. Terrific PP cannon, but he still needs to develop his on ice reads away from shoot, shoot and shoot and also survey his options. Could develop more defensive commitment and work away from the puck."
8,2017,Casey Mittelstadt,"Thick, strong high schooler who dominates the entire ice. Moves quickly and efficiently into the attack zone and tilts the ice with continual carries that create advantageous looks for his team. Seems to be far superior to his present teammates, and it lessens his dominance. If his hockey IQ reads openings on the ice and linemates don't see what he does, they are less likely to be in advantageous.  This makes him seem less effective, but his high skills are less evident. You are selecting him and waiting as he develops. Committed to University of Minnesota."
7,2017,Lias Andersson,"Smart positional strong centre with a high compete level and willingness to throw his body around.Son of Niklas who scored a half a point a game as an NHL pro, he also displays strong offensive skills. High hockey IQ who knows where everybody is and where things are going. A complete player in all phases and zones who leads by example. Stands up for his teammates. Never stops working in the attack zone and more importantly in the defensive zone. Has a hitch in his stride as he is a short choppy strider, but it in no way deters his advancement to the higher levels of play. And edgy centre who seems to be able to quickly adjust to new linemates and making the better. His stint in the Four Nations tourney in November playing alongside RW Carl Grundström (Toronto draft pick).and LW Elias  Pettersson saw them dominate. He scored a couple in the World Junior U-20 also."
6,2017,Cody Glass,"Late bloomer with excellent speed, quick hands, and sneaky release. Since last season he gained 20+ pounds and grew more than a couple inches, making him tough to push of the puck in his possessions. Has a high hockey sense - finds the open seams, gets open, and anticipates where the puck will be. Strong on the puck, keeping it away from from opposing defenders. Displays excellent all-around speed. He looks to get even bigger and stronger, and has significant upside."
3,2017,Miro Heiskanen,"Undersized defenseman who continues to shine impressively in every international showings. Although he is slightly built and in need of beef and more muscle, he is very athletic, and has shown himself an equal to the grown men playing against him in the Finnish pro league. He possesses high end mobility, agility, an excellent skating stride and vision and makes solid defensive zone reads. A four-direction skater who easily transitions to his back pedal and calmly handles the attacker when middle zone turnovers happen. He is very good around his own net, and has a very active stick, clogs lanes and either moves the puck to the right place in transitions, or will skate the puck out, even under pressure. Plays calm and makes good decisions under pressure in his own end. Reads and anticipates the play well, activating from the defensive position flawlessly as he carries and passes the puck so well. A power play quarterback who distributes well and gets it on net when he shoots. The negative is that he may not be able to get that much bigger and needs girth and muscle. So he is what he is: a extremely agile puck carrier who simply is not a big man. Hasn't the NHL had room for a few of these?"
4,2017,Cale Makar,"This small defender has all the making of a future NHL offenseman. Seems to be in constant motion, and able to intercept pucks and turn them in to quick strikes towards his opponent's net. Very undersized and will need plenty more muscle as he continues his development. Cleary one of the smarter and better offensively talented Dmen in the class. The PP QB on his Alberta Junior League team, and has a quick release of a point shot that he gets off without taking a big backswing. He displays strong wrists take enable him to get strength on his shots and zip on his passes. After being selected to play in the World junior Challenge, it what might have been viewed as a step up in competition compared to the players he faces in the AJHL -- but he looked dominant in many phases, using his lateral agility and athletic strides to cut through the neutral zone, activating to open space on the give and go, and reading ensuing plays and covering huge areas of the ice with his feet. His speed and good edging work in consort with his ability to handle the puck at top speed. When he is doesn't have the puck, he looks to jump on errant passes or ones sent cross ice changing possessions. Will pinch but always gets back in position in a few strides because he's so quick. Holds a strong gap. This is a player who creates space and time and plays smart. More of a long term development project -- but he is a player."
5,2017,Elias Pettersson,"Top scorer on his team  on a point a game pace. even though he is more of a playmaker, he scores some really pretty goals. Very strong on the puck and an all-around high skilled player whose hands, head, and feet make things happen. Very agile and slippery. Has an extra gear and slick stick. Can cut and slash through tight space and draws penalties because of it. A selfless give and go player, he excels as a power play guy with an exciting future. Lias was added as their centre in the Four Nations U-20 tourney in November, playing alongside Carl Grundström (Toronto draft pick) and was a dominant player in the tourney."
1,2017,Nico Hischier,"The best Swiss player in the 2016 World U-18s, graduated to become their best player in the 2017 World U-20. He is a centre-wing with quickness and skill. Has a scorer's mentality, but displays high passing skills to go along with his elusiveness. Great vision and follow through. He reads the play in both ends and when in control of the puck, he uses his soft hands and stick skills to move the pace of the game. Plays fast. Is great on his edges and his agility lets it appear as if he fazed in from nowhere to control pucks and score. Maybe more importantly, he seems anchored to the ice sheet -- unfazed by contact -- and plays strong on the puck, continuing through traffic to finish. In a congested crease area, he seems to root around and find the truffle before others realize it's in the back of the net. He takes the pucks in open areas, reads the ice in front of him, slashes through defenders in the hard areas to the front and lets it fly with an extremely quick deceptive release. Adequate in his own end (positionally strong), but he knows what side his bread is buttered. Not big or edgy, and there is room for growth in both areas, but displays toughness in how he attacks, attacking the box and letting his sneaky wrist shot fly. In a draft class with the early marquee choices injured and the best of the rest seeing their production fall off, why not first over-all? He lacks thickness and can add pounds and muscle."
197,2014,Olivier LeBlanc,"Undersized lightweight defenseman with good vision, puck moving ability. Passes the puck well handles his defensive responsibilities despite the fact he may be a long term guy who needs weight and muscle to ascend up the ladder."
2,2017,Nolan Patrick,"To most he is the 2017 draft class front-runner who does everything well.  His greatest strengths at this point are his on-ice vision, maturity and competitiveness. Hopefully he will continue to improve into a three-zone player. He is already big and has displayed a notable improvement in his skating, mobility and strength. Excellent stop and start skater who explodes away from defenders. Light on his edges; difficult to contain when on the fly. Patrick is a terrific passer who holds the puck until just the right moment and then finds his spot. Goes to the net hungrily and with all possible dispatch. A good decision maker; his development is coming along nicely, especially  skating and on-ice pacing. Nephew of James Patrick."
195,2014,Patrick Sanvido,Giant defenseman with a good stick and shot blocking ability. His feet get him to the player he wants to punish. Limited upside at this point until he gets better on his pins. Has room to fill out even more and increase mobility.
199,2014,Pavel Jenys,"Big strong two way forward with a two way game, who plays strong on his skates and is strong on the puck. Good with the puck on his stick, and an excellent shot. Has little aggression or push in the attack zone, and he needs to develop fast first steps."
194,2014,Kevin Elgestål,"Still developing power wing who sets up shop in front and is far from docile in terms of engagement. Didn’t see lots of ice time and is going to need a few seasons to figure out things and add weight and muscle. Need to gain first step quickness, but once in motion, he can get going fairly fast and show agility in his carries. Has a good shot that will improve as he gets stronger. Strong on the forecheck and has some upside as a bottom six winger."
196,2014,Axel Holmström,Prototypical Swedish two way centre who takes care of his end and then thinks the offensive side.  A solid six footer with a solid work ethic decent hands and smart playmaking skills. Likes to wait and hold the puck that split second and wait for lanes to open up. Not a banger but physical enough to go to the front or work all the battle areas. Was Nylander's centre in the World Junior U-18s.
191,2014,Jared Fiegl,"Two-way power winger who may never skate well enough to be a top six player, but displays a strong over-all game as a wall player. Wins puck battles and has the strength to cause problems there. Has improved his heavy boots,and become a good three zone competitor with good feet and fluidity. Uses his size and plays fast. Developing player."
192,2014,Matt Ustaski,"Glenview Illinois native is raw big man with good skills and feet, Far from develomentally ready, he is committed to the University of Wisconsin, where he will get time to advance"
187,2014,Kyle Jenkins,"Langy two-way defender with who needs weight and strength training in order to advance his game. Displays good feet, puck and possession skills, and hockey smarts but needs that additional girth and power to continue his upward spiral."
188,2014,Pierre Engvall,"Look good in the Five Nations Tourney as a big speedy power forward with an all-around game and plenty of hustle. Strong on the puck, and displays good vision in the attack zone. Has a solid defensive game, is very good forechecker, and plays on the PK.  Very aggressive and stirs the pot on the attack. At thsi point doesn't show accurate decision making when carrying, and he doesn't really show good haves yet."
193,2014,Edgars Kulda,"Almost matched his season totals in the WHL playoffs, due to the fact he was buried on the Championship Oil Kings veteran roster until injuries hit and he got to get more than fourth line duty. Showed he could play well in the battle zones with good skills and abilities. As import players usually take a bit to get strong and adjust, he may be a player who gets selected as a longer term prospect, Based on his play down the stretch, and his being named the MVP at the Memorila Cup, he has raised his status to a early round pick."
190,2014,Francis Perron,"Soft-handed smooth skating  offensive generator who displays nice offensive instincts and puck skills but at this juncture is thin and of average height. Nonetheless, he enters March with over 50 points. Long term prospect who will need to bulk up and grow stronger."
185,2014,Cameron Darcy,"Plays a physical style, and has good hands. Skating is a work in progress."
179,2014,Ivan Nalimov," A third year eligible with good feet, glove and solid positioning. Possessed NHL goaler mechanics and in the Subway Super Series put on some incredible performance."
178,2014,Dylan Sikura,"A really smooth passing centre-forward who is a good set up man in the OJHL. He is committed to Northeastern University.  Has a good shot, great vision and a willingness to drive the net, and projects as winger long-term. Needs work on improving his skating stride, adding weight and strength, Comes from a rags to riches family story."
175,2014,Adam Ollas Mattsson,"Big stay-at -home defenseman project who has a long reach, and the willingness to use his size to his advantage on all engagements. Makes the simple best outlet and doesn't try to get cute. Not the strongest or quickest afoot, at this juncture, and can have trouble with quicker attackers and can be rattled when under heavy forecheck. He is able to slow play down and looks like a decent long term project on the backline."
174,2014,Maximilian Pajpach,"Agile goalie with good reflexes, lateral movement, glove and pads."
176,2014,Samuel Blais,"Undersized QMJHL centre/wing with good feet, hands and get-up. Improved his draft status by continued attention to the defensive side of his game."
180,2014,Matthew Mistele,"A sniper pure and simple. Skates really well and balanced, gains separation, and always gets open and ready to fire his array of terrific shots. Displays a great feel in the offensive zone and his hands help provide even more room for him.  Very coachable and mature, he needs more strength and time to develop as an all-around two-way player. Has room to fill out, and hopefully gain a bit more edge. Showed up for the playoffs."
173,2014,Jaden Lindo,"Big strong winger who is far from being polished player. Has good wheel and speed, but still learning the game as a attacker and defender. Not easy to knock off balance. Has shone times when he plays with a bit of nasty, but not with any consistency. Good in the corners, plays well without the puck, and although not the best developed offensive skilled guy,has potential"
172,2014,Chandler Yakimowicz,"Big feisty Pennsylvania-born centreman who is just starting to come into his own. Feet are still catching up with the growth spurt, but already has shown some quickness.  Long term developmental project at forward. Was part of the USA NTTP Junior team and played a few games with the USA U-18."
170,2014,Cristiano DiGiacinto,An aggressive grinder with good passing skills and a mean streak. Need first step quickness as it takes time for him to get to top speed. Passes the puck well and is a hard working reliable defensive player and an agitating forechecker who makes things difficult. has a shot too.
169,2014,Reid Duke,Has shown potential to be a top pick by way of his elusive skating and puck-handling and above average speed. Has some grit is strong on the puck and very good one on one. The problem is he is inconsistent shift to shift and needs to be a 60 minute player. Maybe further weight training and strength will build his game in this area.
167,2014,Chase Lang,"Slick skating centre-forward who has a very high skill set. Excels on the power play. Goes into the dirty areas. Has a good accurate shot, and good hands. Very agile and elusive, but also steady in the defensive zone. Needs to get bigger and stronger, but is a late bloomer who might pay dividends."
164,2014,Pavel Kraskovsky,"Russian youngster with good offensive talent, feet and eyes for the game. Has a huge frame to add size and muscle where presently there is none."
168,2014,Radel Fazleev,"After a lengthy absence due to a wrist injury, the Russian-born forward returned to displays strong leg drive and upper core strength as he climbed into the conversation as a late round pick. Has strong hockey sense and abilities, but needs time to continue to develop."
159,2014,Steven Spinner,"Under six foot is thick and possesses good vision, excellent speed, and good puck skills. Need to develop  a better game away from the puck, especially in the defensive zone."
162,2014,Aaron Irving,"Western league defender with a solid all-around two-way game.  Very active stick, good gap control and defensive positioning. can make the outlet pass out of his zone, but also carry the mail if it is not an option. In his first full year in the dub he is confident with the puck and physical when separating the attacker from it. Makes the safe outlet pass well. Has a bit of edge to his game."
154,2014,Aaron Haydon,"He is never going to be recognized as a puck carrying dee-man, he nonetheless does have a good shot and some up-ice ability. He is better off when he sticks to the things he excels in, like being the large mobile defender who gets to the attackers and takes them out with aggression, big hits, and downright challenges. Unafraid to knock on the door of the other team's toughest guy and ask him to come out and play. Has decent range of his skates, good balance and a nice reach to break things up. Big defenseman who plays a solid defensive game by keeping it simple. Uses his size and clears the front. Can be pressured into mistakes when rushed, and is working to improve his puck handling ability.  Was named to the USA Developmental team playing in the Ivan Hlinka Tournament."
152,2014,Joey Dudek,"Prep school Centre-wing who has a compact solid body and good hockey smarts. His biggest strength is his playmaking as he strings things and waits for things to develop before passing. Has good balance and jump, and is more meat and potatoes as an attacker who will take a hit to make a play, but tends to be a perimeter. Not over physical on either end, but hopefully when he gains strength and girth as he advances, he plays a more complete game as an attacker and a defender. Was named to the USA Developmental team playing in the Ivan Hlinka Tournament. Committed to Boston College"
151,2014,Christopher Brown,"Lightweight centerman with elite feet, soft touch and goal scoring ability. Displays good anticipation and can play fast. So far he hasn't really played in competition where he has met much physicality, so that will be a concern."
146,2014,Anders Bjork,Average sized player who plays both wings and projects as a third line line wing. An impressive skater with good strength in his stride that enables him to be a difference in transition. Has a heavy wrister and makes attack zone turnovers that lead into scoring chances. Is strong on the puck on the wall and handles physicality. His energy and work ethic is contagious and his has upside.
145,2014,Anthony Angello,Huge punishing centre with a strong defensive presence and a large physical commitment in the offensive zone. Effective checker excellent wall worker. He makes the enemy work hard in the battle zones. Uses the gifts of size and long reach to win in those areas. Developmental pick that projects as bottom end centre-forward who will be difficult to play against.
139,2014,Tanner Faith,"A huge defenseman who season was marred two shoulder surgeries. Has fallen behind in terms of development, but has displayed good work in his own end with decent physicality and hard play in front of his net. Knows his present limitations and plays inside them. His feet need work but his active controlled aggression may get his name called out."
138,2014,Oskar Lindblom,"Two way wing with good size and instinctive scoring prowess. Not really gifted as a balanced or quick skater, he plods back and forth with little acceleration or quickness. That being said, skating can be improved. His gift is incredible hand/eye coordination that is used by him gaining position inside the circles and him delivering goals on deflections, rebounds and passes. Can pick an area of the net and quickly releases acquired pucks to the back of the netting. Will work the wall and use his size. He was selected to the roster for the World Junior Under-18 Tournament in April."
137,2014,Tyler Bird,"Longer term prospect who is committed to Brown University.  A drive to the net, handle the boards guy with physicality, size and girth. His strong body and build already work well and co-ordinated with his feet. Granted, it takes a couple strides for him to get to top speed, but once going he has a powerful stride and balance that make him difficult to derail. Will get bigger and stronger. It's not like he doesn't have moves, scoring ability or power at the present New England HS level. Plays nonstop and you know he is out there, especially if you are the opposition."
141,2014,Luc Snuggerud,"Unbridled offenseman who is a tremendous puck carrier with PP QB qualities, dangle, and transition skills. The question may be is just a riverboat gambler, or somewhat lacking in the IQ to understand situations and the ice to utilize team attack or does he disregard it to go one man show. Long term project with need of more strength and less predicability in his  attack skills.  Committed to the University of Nebraska-Omaha."
147,2014,Daniel Audette,"His bloodlines and elusiveness put the undersized Audette on scout's radar because of his skill,speed and heart. His skating base, and lower body strength make him strong on the puck and a guy who plays big and is a scoring threat at a moment's notice. Reads the ice and can handle the puck at his top gear, but also he can go laterally with sharp cuts and stop/starts to get loose. His vision allows him to slip away and act on the room he has made for himself, as he passes the puck extremely well and also works hard in his own end back checking. Looks like a good long term selection who may help a team down the road."
149,2014,Rourke Chartier,"Undersized centre with very good speed, quickness and feel for the soft areas to position himself in. At this point, he is big enough or physically strong enough to overcome the road blocks that opponents became. He is unable to maintain ground or possession on many an occasion. Understand his defensive responsibilities and knows how to attack. He needs to bigger all around to undertake them adequately."
133,2014,Dysin Mayo,"Long term project on defense who has the wheels, but has yet to understand when to use them. Very raw in his own end, and runs around too much. Must learn when to activate into offense. Needs work on his outlets in transition. It is his earnest compete level and confidence he can make plays out of the ordinary that may lead to teams moving off him developmental. Might just grow his game into a strong and patient one."
134,2014,Shane Gersich,"Flyer with game breaking ability and snarl. Tremendous shot, powerful burst with a great feel for offensive. Can be creative with the pass or let go a heavy blast or one-timer. Strong skater with the ability to spurt through and around defenders and has enough edge to compete against anyone. Plays bigger than he is. Good in the dot. Is passionate as a defensive forechecker and attacker to the front. Strong on the puck and fearless yet undersized. He might be the hidden fireplug of the crop."
131,2014,Ryan Rehill,Best fist fighter in the class.
128,2014,Dakota Joshua,"Big framed developmental project with excellent reach, puck skills and a 200 foot game. A good skater who once in a specialized weight training program will gain power in his stride and get a lot bigger. That will make him even more of a problem when he sets up in front or battles along the wall. Already uses his reach, and works the wall fairly well. Committed to Ohio Stare University."
140,2014,Daniel Walcott,"Under six footer with an offensive side to his physical defensive style. Quick on his feet and plays with an edge. Has good vision and a decent shot. A strong shutdown defender in the Q, who battles as well as any  player in the league."
130,2014,Liam Coughlin,Committed to Boston University.
129,2014,C. J. Franklin,"Was named to the U.S. World Junior A roster for the Junior A Challenge. Third year eligible who isn’t big, but definitely has grown his game. Excellent lateral mobility, quickness ability to creat chances as he forces takeovers with good forechecking and banging. Creative and shifty. Some team may take a chance."
126,2014,Gustav Forsling,Stood out at the World Junior U-18 as a future offensive contributor from the backline. A good puck mover who has a cannon that he lets go from both the point and when he moves up into the play. Displays  veteran-like recognition in his reads and his ability to hold possessions in the defensive zone. Will need to make huge strides the weight room in order to handle NHL defensive duties. Is very aggressive defensively and can close down on attackers entering his defensive zone. But his lack of elite quickness and defensive girth may limit his projection as a pro.
127,2014,Clark Bishop,"Positionally strong centre with high-end acceleration and a strong two way game. Works hard all over the sheet, despite not having the superior hands or the ability to finish plays with goals or great set-ups. Good penalty killer. willing to do all the little things it takes to win."
124,2014,Jaedon Descheneau,"Fireplug who uses his solid frame to play like a much bigger forward.  Has soft hands, above average hockey IQ, and pistons that don't stop moving, working hard to pressure down low.  His shot and awareness game in and out show that he is that rare bird that can defy odds and continue up the ladder to the big leagues. Might take a few too many shots from the perimeter, but isn't afraid of the battle areas."
142,2014,Tyler Nanne,Great bloodline in this smaller but gifted package that  can generate chances from all forward positions and from the backline as an attacker. Has excellent agility and offensive instincts as a defenseman. Good in transition and gets by defensively with good positioning. At the high school level was an excellent penalty killer too. Did I mention he is Lou nanne's grandson?
122,2014,Richard Nejezchleb,"So far has been passed on in two draft years, due to the fact that he had the tools, but the toolbox was considered empty. Has the size, but is lacking a first step and his stride is short. He is not balanced or agile. Once moving he can create separation against defenders and passes the puck well in traffic. Good wall game. The transfer from the Czech Republic to the Wheatkings  did show a more physical side emerge. Regardless of his negatives, he has a strong quick stick and good hands, but needs consistency along with better skating technique."
120,2014,Steven Johnson,Two way defenseman. Commited to the University of Minnesota. Was named to the U.S. World Junior A roster for the Junior A Challenge.
123,2014,Matthew Berkovitz,"Poised defenseman with great skating fluidity and poise to his game. not a bruiser and not a blazer, but the strength of his play is based on his patient use of his feet as a defender and with his activating on offense.  Great walking the blue line on the PP. Uses his skating to close down on attackers quickly so they have no time or space. Can be cat-like patent, giving the attackers room and time, and then  before they knock he catches that mouse. Not very physical at this point, sticking to basics but has shown he can ratchet up a notch. Was the best back-liner of the Fall elite league. He was a memnber of Team Wisconsin. and has committed to the University of Wisconsin."
121,2014,Max Willman,Second year eligible centre with very good puck skills and a deceptively fast energizer bunny with great lateral mobility and edging. Can make plays at a high tempo.  Clocks in at six foot and 180 and will need to get stronger.A longer range prospect who might develop into more of a complimentary offensive generator. Committed to Brown University.
125,2014,Nikolas Koberstein,Committed to the University of Alaska - Fairbanks.
117,2014,Michael Bunting,"A late bloomer who entered the OHL as an 18 year old rookie. Very good vision, speed, hands, and quick shot.  Finds the open soft areas, and makes space by getting open.  An under the radar prospect who shows good upside. He needs bulk, strength and time."
118,2014,Igor Shesterkin,Russian goaltender who dominated the MHL junior league before being elevated to the KHL parent club. Agile and and good angie goalie. Whomever takes him will wait and see if the selection pays off.
119,2014,Ben Thomas,"A strong two-way defender with size, skills and a very high compete level. Excellent puck handler with soft hands and the skill and initiative to use his quick start ability to handle things solo. Developing power play guy, he uses his quick stick and body to break attacks up. Needs work on his back ward skating game. Not shy at shouldering the play at both ends."
114,2014,Alexis Pepin,"A big man who shows grit and competitive spirit. His size and ferocity cause opponents fits in the attack zone as he makes contact with impact. Good all around player and decent in his defensive zone. The knock comes by the fact that while he is a good skater, he just doesn't have that quickness you would like on the attack. In small areas, there really isn't an issue, and he can set up, move out, and stay with opponents. The questions them becomes is he a player that can eventually play in your top six, or can he continue as a centre effectively at higher competition levels."
115,2014,Brent Moran,"Second year eligible goaler with good reflexes, athleticism and tracks the puck well."
107,2014,Julien Pelletier,Smaller Q league centre who is able to generate offense with good smarts and hands. Reads the ice well and finds the open spots along with the open man.  Longer term project who will need to get stronger thicker and improve his feet.
109,2014,Kaapo Kähkönen,"Finnish 'tender with decent size and agility. Has good quickness post to post. Has good rebound control, good blocker and glove hand."
103,2014,J. J. Piccinich,"Thick six foot wing with a strong powerful stride, plays strong on the puck and evolved into a good scorer as the season went on. He finds the open seem and gets open. Has a nice wrist shot that he lets go quickly with power. He shows defensive responsibility out there, and may develop at the next level."
110,2014,Austin Poganski,"Big wing who plays strong and fast. Has a powerful long stride and can carry defenders when crashing down low. Plays strong on the puck, with good hands and scoring smarts. Strong hard competitor who wins in the battle zones, wall, and behind the net. Always keeps his feet moving and makes chances for himself. Also displays good East-West lateral ability. Much to like in this developing wing. Was named to the U.S. World Junior A roster for the Junior A Challenge."
112,2014,Viktor Arvidsson,Third year eligible is an undersized skilled attacker who uses his quick feet and motor to attack the net with reckless abandon. A scorer who lives to take the shot. Good one on one. Good quick release. He works hard in the defensive aspects. His game is far from rounded and at this point is dependent upon linemates feeding him.
105,2014,Michael Prapavessis,"With the lack of high-end sure thing rushing offensivemen in the draft class, this long term project has superb feel and hockey sense, a good feeling for the attack, and makes tape to tape passes. His shot is fairly weak, and his defensive game is far from poised and his physicality is nonexistent. Has the tools but needs development to his body and his game."
101,2014,Nelson Nogier,"Big defender who is a strong balanced skater with good mobility, and excellent defensive awareness. Takes good angles and close well, and use his active stick well to break things up. Keeps his goalies sight lines open by clearing attackers out. At this juncture it appears he has many of the tools to be a solid shut down defender with a possible payoff down the line as a player with some offensive side to his game. Has the size and frame to fill out even bigger. A smart defenseman who reads and reacts with calm demeanor. Uses his stick to break up plays and stop advances. His great mobility allows him to close down on attackers, move laterally to force attackers to the outside and handle one on ones. Clears the front. Much to like in this developing player."
98,2014,Frederik Olofsson,Third year eligible Swedish winger.
100,2014,Shane Eiserman,"Second year eligible late birthday who is a disciplined attacking wing with nice size and fluidity to his feet. Thick build and naturally strong and powerful, but lacks first step quickness and projects as a grinder/power winger at this juncture. Loves to initiate contact and is best down low in the attack zone. Is a battler on the wall and in front and causes problems for defenders. Projects as a North-South power winger who has a skill game to match his physicality. Has committed to the University of New Hampshire."
104,2014,Ryan Mantha,"Has been man-sized since he was 16, and was converted to a dee-man due to his size and  temperament. Has a big hard shot, and is good at getting the puck to his mates. He will need more lateral ability to close better,but he does a fine job of clearing the front and protecting teammates. Was named to the USA Developmental team playing in the Ivan Hlinka Tournament. Was named to the U.S. World Junior A roster for the Junior A Challenge."
102,2014,Alexis Vanier,"Huge defender who is starting to develop edge, as he improves his all-around game and feet. must make big strides in terms of stop/starts, and lateral movement if he is to to be given consideration if he wants his name called."
96,2014,Josh Wesley,"Son of Glenn doesn’t have makings of an up-size difference maker but plays a solid defensive game to his present abilities as a possible future shutdown defender as he is already strong, and understand the defensive side. At this juncture his feet and over all strength need plenty of work. Once he improves there, he can hone his safe, risk-free style to climb the ladder. Developmental prospect."
99,2014,Chase De Leo,"Undersized centre with high energy and aggressiveness despite a lack of size. Good in tight on the attack, and has great quickness to cause turnovers. Good on both PP and PK. Wins face-offs. Blocks shots. Never quits. Plays big."
94,2014,Ville Husso,"Top European goaltender who displays good technique, athleticism, glove and fluid movement. He was selected to the roster for the World Junior Under-18 Tournament in April."
97,2014,Lucas Wallmark,"Under six foot elite skilled center/wing who is an offensive generator who never quits in his attempts to make plays or score. Good in the face-off circle, and good in all three zones. He has been selected to the roster for the World Junior Under-18 Tournament ithe last two years. A heel injury made teams wary of selecting him in 2013."
92,2014,Joe Wegwerth,Projects as a power forward. has above average speed and a powerful stride and can hold possession on the entrance.Takes pucks away on the wall. has a good shot. uses his size to drive to the front. will inflict pain via contact. Has not yet rounded his offensive game and is a few years away from be considered for an NHL roster.
91,2014,William Lagesson,"All-around defenseman with size, excellent speed, and a strong two-way game.  Is not a physical defender but will use his size to wall players off. Has an active stick in the defensive zones, and displays lateral mobility. Has good jump and carries the puck well and makes crisp outlet passes. Needs work in all phases, and projects are a long term developmental selection."
90,2014,Mike Amadio,"Solid two way centre with good vision, quick stick, and good jump once he get the legs churning. Wins 50-50 pucks, sets up screens in front, and has some bang to his game. Thinks the game well, and is willing to do the work to make a play. Has improved his work in the defensive zone. As he progresses, it is hoped he plays with intensity every shift."
88,2014,Beau Starrett,"Intriguing prospect from a hockey family with great height and attractive potential. Has the size but will remain a longer term prospect until he gets better coordinated and more muscle on his long skinny frame. There is lots to like and wait for. He has put points on the board, and plays a tenacious forechecking role. Strong on the puck. He has decent hands and a nice hard shot. Is a very good skater and once he puts muscle on, he may be a player. He is a future shutdown centre with toughness."
86,2014,Mark Friedman,"Impressive skater with good speed, agility, stick skills, and will take the body. Committed to Bowling Green State University."
87,2014,Anton Karlsson,"Aggressive pounding forward who played like a North American style winger for Sweden at the 2013 World Junior Under-18 Tournament. Heavy hitter who the opposition remembers. makes contact hard in corners and in front. Works the cycle well, because he gets room. Let's loose a heavy shot. Agitates. Handles the puck well in traffic and has good hands and feet."
84,2014,Kyle Wood,Big OHL defender whose game is a work in progress. Already displays toughness and has yet to put all the parts together. Growing into his size. A team will select him and help with putting the parts in place.
89,2014,Nathan Walker,"Australian born 20 year old who is draft eligible, and due to a rule stipulation is playing for the AHL pro team the Hersey Bears."
83,2014,Matheson Iacopelli,3rd year eligible wing is a scorer with hard wrist shot and quick release. Strong when carrying on the attack and is able to find the soft areas in the attack zone for the set-up pass. Well balanced skater  with a set of gears. So far he isn't very interested in the defensive zone. Committed to Western Michigan University.
85,2014,Keegan Iverson,"Big thick potential power winger in the making. Plays a robust take no prisoners style that has him leaving the opposition looking for him and losing track of the play. Far from a proven scorer, he does have the strength, energy, and passion to continue improving his offensive abilities. Does possess a heavy shot and soft hands that get the puck to teammates to provide scoring chances."
81,2014,Dylan Sadowy,"Feisty winger who isn’t the prettiest skater but is has quickness in his long strides that gets him involved on both ends of the ice. Is smart with the puck and has a quick shot that netted him 27 goals. Is a battler in play and will drop ’em. A gamer who will block shots,  and compete hard out there for 60 minutes. can fill out and get stronger in the lower body to get even quicker, but is showing there may be enough to make the NHL grade in the lower lines."
79,2014,Brayden Point,Diminutive centre with keen offensive instincts at feet that are always moving. Fast enough that he eludes checks and seems to dart out from nowhere to receive passes and get scoring chances. He couples that elusiveness with tremendous stick-handling ability and great touch down low. Hard-working smaller player with excellent jump and ability to pressure. Relentless in pursuit and responsible in his own end. Generates offense with his passes and steals.
76,2014,Elvis Merzlikins,one of the longshots is this young Latvian goaler who took the Swiss  Senior league by storm.
73,2014,Brett Lernout,"Very large intimidating defender who projects as a 6 or 7 who takes advantage of his chances to play by arriving in a bad mood ready to punish the opposition with ever chance. Not just a bruiser. He will make it hard for you to play against him, but shows some patience and awareness when he is in possession for his team or in the neutral zone. Painfully clears the front. Closes out his man on the entrance, so the rusher remembers it. I am not sure if he is completely adjusted to his growing body, as he will look pretty smooth on his pins on the carry until HE gets jostled. He is not looking to be the offensive force in his pairing, but passes pretty well and has a good shot from the perimeter. There is room for him to get bigger and stronger, and with that his balance and feet may catch up."
74,2014,Brycen Martin,"All-around solid defender who displays a very solid defensive game and enough skating ability to advance to the higher levels. Understands his end of the ice and takes care of it as his primary duty. He can clear the front, handle wall work, and maintain possession in the corners. He is positionally strong and maintains his ground well when attackers press. Is able to keep composure and make that all-important transition pass out. Skates well enough that there is an offensive upside to his game. He is a player you don't notice, because he isn't making huge mistakes that bring him into the light."
77,2014,Blake Siebenaler,"Mobile defenseman whose up-ice game is far more polished than his back end play. Has good size, hands and feet. Fairly new to the defense position since converting from forward. Projects as a long term project that must learn the defensive nuances of his zone and improve his play in his own zone. Good puck carrier who has excellent hands and passing skills and advanced to being a regular on the point of the Icedog PP, and playing big minutes each game."
93,2014,Nick Magyar,"In a draft where many post first round scoring forwards are smaller, this kid has the offensive ability and frame to grow into a good player.  Plays a smart responsible game that is less fancy. Not a fancy lateral guy who dekes here and there-but uses his good hands, anticipation, vision, and a strong forecheck to attack. Has a physical side. Finishes checks, uses his size on the wall, and then gets open. More weight room and development might add muscle that will help improve his leg drive and foot speed. And as so many youngsters he needs work on the defensive side, but plenty of upside there."
70,2014,Miles Gendron,"Former Centre converted full time to defense. Committed to the U Conn. but that will not be until 2015. Might be five years from the team selecting him having to make the decision. Displays excellent quickness and skating ability. Quick to the puck carrier. When carrying, he reads the ice and  has several gears. Usually one of the fastes players in any game against any opponent. Long term project with lots fo questions but also lots to like."
82,2014,Jake Walman,"Long term blue line prospect who started as a solid skating centreman who was moved to defense, where he plays tough in his own end, and displays excellent up-ice attack instincts. Has size and uses it Excells as a PP pointman due to his shot. Not really a mail carrier, and far from ready but an intriguing prospect. Played for the Team Canada East at the World Junior A Challenge in Nova Scotia. Committed to Providence College."
69,2014,Jack Glover,"Rising Team USA defender with size, four direction skating ability and poise which projects him as a top round pick.  A confident passer and strong defensive zone player. Excellent passer even under pressure. Makes the stretch pass with success. Remains unshaken under pressure in his end and is physically able to handle attackers. Positions himself really well and is always aware of the entire ice, and is able to slow things down and calm situations while under forechecking pressure. Big smart defenseman with nice upside."
68,2014,Rinat Valiev,"Mobile defender with emerging defensive abilities and good up ice instincts. Good soft hands. His long term potential was on a huge upswing until he decided after the Five Nations Tourney, to return home to mother Russia without warning to his Indy teammates and staff. He is being reported as out indefinitely ""due to injury"", and that injury might have be North American culture overdose.  He wasn't attempting to learn English and it also caused issue to him being coachable. You have to wonder if this player who at one point potential first rounder has dropped his stock completely out of the draft, but now has resurfaced on the Kootenay squad with new commitment."
72,2014,Alex Schoenborn,"Under-rated bottom nine wing player with size, skill, and tenacity.  Gives 100% effort  in all phases. A linch pail player who doesn't get cute. Go after his teammate and see how he responds.  He also will draw the opposition into the box as they respond to his hard hits, strong forecheck, and aggression in puck battles. May never be a huge offensive talent but most certainly does all the right stuff to eventually contribute on an NHL roster."
71,2014,Connor Chatham,"Has so many of the qualities teams look for: size, a quick first step, acceleration gears, puck handling ability, a shot and some physicality. Then you look at the measly 13 goals and 31 points and wonder if it’s because despite all the tools, he isn’t he’s leaving the toolbox at home?  He has committed to the University of Denver, where hopefully he will hone his game to the point where there is some offensive consistency, a sixity minute commitment and an education on defensive zone coverage."
65,2014,Juho Lammikko,"Winger who plays hard and has a decent wrist shot. A determined two-way player, who lacks creativity, great feet, or puck skills, so he sticks to a fairly simple game. Plays very hard on the puck and is a good in tight. Is a problem in the paint and along the boards, and is always willing to get dirty and pay the price. handles the puck at high his top speed, and is pretty fast. Was called up to the senior team. Looks like a long term project, but one worth the wait."
66,2014,Nikita Tryamkin,Chara-size russian giant who was drafted last time around. Plays with an over-supply of nasty.  Knows he is far from the polished mobile backliner so plays inside his limitations.  His skating is rough with balance issues and lack off jump and he is better without too much handling of the puck. Long term project with an upside to be a shutdown defender once the feet and muscle and game figure it out.
67,2014,Warren Foegele,"Solid two-way winger with good jump. Late bloomer you grew five inches and never got interest from junior teams, but has put up good numbers and impressive full ice game. He disp[lays a long stride with power and really good speed. Fearless in traffic, and also gritty when he doesn’t. Strong lower body and seems strong on the puck at the present level. Has good puck skills and hands. A long term prospect who will need to develop more instinct and grow as the competition does."
75,2014,Alex Peters,"Big defender who can play with some physicality. The real positives is that he already skates so very well and fluid for a large man. Has quick feet and can close laterally too. Pivots real well, and have good control while skating, and being able to position himself strikingly fast to chase & defend, or get to pucks and pass them up in transition. Can play hard and strong and battle in the corners and on the wall. At this point, most teams will like what they see, but hope for a bit more of an offensive game."
64,2014,Brandon Hickey,Smart all-around defender with excellent four way mobility and jump.  Good PP performer with strong point shot. His lightness on his edges help him activate quickly to carry the play on the attack. good passer. Long term payoff is what teams will be getting as he will have to adjust as the levels of competition increase.
61,2014,Jonas Johansson,"Big Swedish tender who covers a lot of net. Displays a good glove, and takes good angles in his set-up. He was selected to the roster for the World Junior Under-18 Tournament in April."
60,2014,Alex Lintuniemi,"Finnish two-way defender with excellent size and strong point shot. had trouble in his transition to the smaller North American rinks and the speed that the defenseman in the OHL must play. Long term prospect who may need a bit more time to improve his all around speed and decision making, he nonetheless is an intriguing prospect if he worst out his boots and adjusts. He was selected to the roster for the World Junior and played in the Under-18 Tournament in April."
58,2014,Christian Dvorak,"Skinny bodied wing with a deadly eye for the net. He will need lots of time to gain strength through a weight program, so he can actually compete on the wall and man to man, where at present, he is dominated. He creative playmaker who displays patience when moving the puck on scoring chances. He is a project with a chance of being a big payoff, because he is pure scorer with deadly finishing instincts."
57,2014,Johnathan MacLeod,"Big strong shutdown defender with good feet and skill. Has some developing offensive game. Plays tough, with polish and calm. Makes the first pass, and is really good and handling the puck and moving up ice too.  looks like a longer wait, but might continue to improve  due to his skating, improving strength and offensive skills. Fourth ranked of the USA quartet of solid defenders, he still is a work in progress in his own end. It would be no surprise if a team willing to wait jumps up and takes him in the second or third."
56,2014,Ryan Donato,"Son of former NHLer Ted, and a solid three zone player who works hard each shift. He might be considered an underrated player based on the fact he doesn’t have high end separation skills or that explosive burst that teams look for. He combines his hustling fearless demeanor with good vision and off the charts hands, displaying what might be top ten hand-eye co-ordination in the class.  Exploits defenses using his instincts and in most games it’s difficult to find another player on the sheet with as much heart and intensity."
59,2014,Brandon Halverson,"Tall lean US goalie prospect who is currently the Soo backup. Displays decent agility , took good angles, lateral agility, and stays square and controls the rebounds. Long term goalie prospect who needs more playing time."
62,2014,Justin Kirkland,Big winger is a late bloomer who played the past seasons at Notre Dame (Sask). Shows the ability to develop into a winger with a power game after some long term work.
54,2014,Hunter Smith,"Gianormous winger who uses his size in all phases. He uses his good hands and reach which combined with grit and intimidation help him make solid plays in both ends of the ice. Can be plain nasty and force opponents into situations were they drop their gloves and hope for the best. Has a very high bar to achieve the status of an all around prospect, but if he continues to improve his game, feet and hands could be a diamond."
52,2014,Maxim Letunov,Tall skinny highly skilled centre with soft hands and finishing ability. Displays a long stride and plenty of quickness. good forechecker who takes pucks back. Works hard away form the puck and is impressively scary down low when he does. Has the frame to fill out nicely with time.
55,2014,Brandon Montour,"A third year eligible dee-man who is an aggressive puck carrier, and attacker. Plays under contra; at a high rate of game speed. Possesses great wheels and gears and explodes past players when he has the puck. Loves to lead the play up ice, and is a strong passer. Has a nice point shot.  Gets his stick in the passing lanes on dee, and isn’t afraid of making contact. At this time, he is very light, and not strong enough. But has elevated himself as one of the better attacking defenseman in the USHL. He is committed to University of Mass. (Amherst)."
53,2014,Noah Rod,"Good balanced power wing prospect who works hard and is very tough to play against because he comes after you. Far from polished on the offensive side but sees the attack zone well has some skill and a good hard shot. Won’t wow you with dazzling moves but has a two gears and once going, makes his presence felt. A North-South guy who drives on the forceheck and is strong on the biscuit when he gets it back, and is hard to contain. Needs plenty of refinement but does have a 3 zone game and commitment but may find a place as a complimentary player. Had a good U-18 tourney fro the Swiss team. A member of his homeland’s team roster for the World Junior Under-20 at Christmas 2014."
51,2014,Jack Dougherty,"Excellent long term defensive prospect with a long frame, light skates, and puck moving skills. Not fancy, makes that first pass, and is poised and confident in his own end. Had upside as a PP guy, with a developing strong point shot and strong wrister. Rangy two-way defender who can carry and move the puck up ice and also provide some mustard and jam as a defender. An effortless skater with great mobility acceleration and elusiveness. Reads the sheet and passes extremely well. Can let loose an excellent shot on the move, put it on the tape, or skate it it in. His natural balance and feet let him close well and body check with power. Was named to the USA Developmental team playing in the Ivan Hlinka Tournament. A developing prospect who is rising up the boards. He is committed to the University of Wisconsin."
63,2014,Dominic Turgeon,"Another long term developmental player with great bloodlines. His father Pierre, was the consummate pro. Has size and ability but didn't show strong game until the Western League playoffs. Was named to the USA Developmental team playing in the Ivan Hlinka Tournament."
49,2014,Vaclav Karabacek,"Rising Czech import presently in the QMJHL. Very smart player with skill and vision. Has some elusiveness but is unafraid of heavy hitting. Has a nice touch to his passes, and loves to hit the soft spots to receive scoring chances and use defenders as screens for his releasing quick shots. Can be strong with the puck and control it in tight. Still needs more strength but has upside long term."
50,2014,Roland McKeown,"Solid all-around defender with excellent balance,  stride and quickness. Positionally solid, and already cool and collected in his game, with excellent vision and reliablity in all situations. Handles the puck well in his own zone, in transistion and on breakouts. displays a hard point shot. If he is able to grow a bit more edge, he will climb up the rankings. He was selected to the roster for the World Junior Under-18 Tournament in April, 2013."
47,2014,Ryan Collins,"Long tall defenseman who is still gaining strength and growing into his body. His development will take time but he already understands the game and has an active stick, and uses it to disrupt the passing lanes and get to loose pucks in the crease area. He is still learning the transition game and is more comfortable playing it simple in his end. As he gains strength and experience, he will add short area skating quickness and become better with his decisions in his own zone. Plenty of upside at both ends of the ice if he works at it."
48,2014,Nicolas Aube-Kubel,"Developing player with excellent straight-line speed and nice touch in his set-ups. Strong at using is body to hurl punishing checks. Was at his best in the QMJHL playoffs against top junior scorers Ehler & Drouin. Is hockey smart in the defensive zone as well as having long term offensive upside. Competes his bags off and is hard to play against. Has a good release, and plays both PK & PP.  Has a chance to develop into an excellent player at making opposition players who are usually strong on the puck weak, by virtue of his determination."
44,2014,Eric Cornel,"Projects as a big second line pivot who has a strong powerful stride, good hockey IQ, and both a strong forecheck and back check. Contributes offensively with good passes and excellent work ethic. Makes up for the lack of high skill set with determination."
46,2014,Julius Bergman,"A longer term prospect who has shown glimpses as a good puck mover and decision-maker. Can join the rush and jump in as the fourth man and is strong on the puck. Plays a bit too tentative, as if he is unsure and can't decide when to commit, make the pass, or start moving and ends up out of position. The fact that he is has good size, but doesn't use it, and seems to get intimidated doesn't inspire scouts to call his name."
45,2014,Brett Pollock,"Playing for a talented Oil Kings team, he is delegated to a third line role. He has nice size and skill and probably can play right wing as well. Good on the cycle, and the forecheck too. Consistent in all zones, and improving as an attacker. Tough and willing to shake things up with a big hit or by dropping the mitts. Long term prospect with upside."
42,2014,Vladislav Kamenev,"Big hard working three zone centre-forward a strong stride, size and very good puck skills. Positionally solid with excellent vision and playmaking abilities. Good in the face off circle. Shoots the puck quickly besides being a strong set-up man. Stood out a one of the better players on the ice in the World Junior A challenge. If the whispers that he is transferring to a CHL junior team are true he seems destined to being picked early. He is a pretty complete player already and is tough to move off the puck, and is excellent in the one on one battles all over the sheet. He may be fairly close to playing soon."
39,2014,Vitek Vanecek,"Goalie for the Silver medal winning Czech Republic team at the U-18 World Championship where he displayed composure and great confidence as he went post to post and battled to steal games as he lead his team by example. Needs work, but  already has glove hand, good technical positioning and excellent lateral movement."
37,2014,Alex Nedeljkovic,"Athletic net minder good footwork, puck handling skills and mobility. Seems tough and quick on the ice, but lacks size at six foot. Displays good lateral quickness, and reads ensuing plays. Last season had 19 wins and only two losses with the Plymouth Whalers."
41,2014,Joshua Jacobs,"A promising two way defender with size and presence. Already displays pro-like decisions and coolness. Has a long reach, and is already functionally strong. Can be the first man due to his smooth powerful quickness and puck carrying abilities. Can really let the puck go. The bonsus is he is difficult to go around on dee, and is a punishing checker whose balance lets him stay in the play after a devastating hit. Much to like about him. Was named to the U.S. World Junior A roster for the Junior A Challenge."
43,2014,Ryan MacInnis,"Tall lanky centre-forward who, at this point, is a projected second or third rounder based on bloodlines and potential. He is Al Macinnis' son. Displays all the tools to be a possible dominating player, but have shown little consistency in his efforts. His size and skill make his an intriguing option who could solidify his grade with better efforts."
36,2014,Thatcher Demko,"Bigger netminder with good lateral movement and down low pad work. Has a strong glove, poise, excellnet athleticism. Developing player who looks to have a pretty good chance of getting his name called fairly early."
34,2014,Mason McDonald,"Big lanky net minder who is good handling the puck and has shown good leg/pad quickness. lots of tools already there for a team to help develop. Part of his progression has been slowed by him having to play behind veteran goaler, Jacob Brennan. calm and controlled and in good position with regularity."
33,2014,Ivan Barbashev,"Hard working centre-wing with quickness, good anticipation, and smarts. Plays on both the PP & PK. Plays with fire in his step, and breaks the strereotype that we tag Russian prospects with. Relishes tough games and difficult match-ups. As good at setting up as shooting, but he is a scorer, with a really quick accurate shot. He can dominate physically at the present level. He was selected to the roster for the World Junior Under-18 Tournament in April."
40,2014,Andreas Englund,"Bigger defender who plays strong on his skates, and displays skill and power from the back line. Far from ready or showing any certain area where he is high end, but the chances of a spike in his development may be coming. Handles the rough going and can give back. Good straight line speed. Reads the situations well, but he is still not handling the puck expertly. The question is can he get a bit more agile and stronger when he has the puck? A member of his homeland’s team roster for the World Junior Under-20 at Christmas 2014."
32,2014,Jayce Hawryluk,"High-skilled winger with a solid three zone game. Displays good speed and keeps moving to stay in the play in all three zones. His skating is strong and well balanced, and he plays strong on the biscuit, and protects it as he tries to create scoring opportunities. Reads and gets open. Shows some snarl and grit. Responsible and in position in his end. Size at this point may be a concern."
38,2014,Marcus Pettersson,"Tall, rail-thin defenseman who has shown he has natural attack and carry skills from the backend. A former centremen with a high hockey IQ but still in the developmental process in terms of body building, functional hockey strength, and learning the nuances of playing defense. Has a strong accurate shot and is a fine passer. Despite lacking experience as a defender, teams will look towards drafting him and watching the parts come together."
28,2014,Josh Ho-Sang,"The Jamacian-Canadian is an all-compass skater with gliding edges who has an advanced skill-set and great jump. Get defenders on their heel as he darts to the open spaces, to the puck carrier, and to shoot the puck. Still a lightweight in need of functional strength, he nonetheless is a threat most times the puck is on his stick. Shoots the puck extremely well. Has soft hands and handles the puck at top speed, and seems to get the jump on defenders and weave his way laterally around them with relative ease. Has an excellent release and an offensive mentality. Will need to get stronger to handle bigger players defending against him. When he has the space he is a dynamic possession player. Tends to depend more on his own abilities and tend to be a one-man show, refusing to pass the puck to open the ice. Sees himself as the best option on most attacks and the opposition has begun to know that. An exciting highly skilled player and finisher who is exciting to watch."
29,2014,Adrian Kempe,"Rising power forward-type player, due to his skating and scoring. Creates problems for defenses because of his determination and jump on the attack. He is a balanced skater with a wide stance and lateral elusiveness. Finished his checks. Has a quick burst, beating defenders on the outside, and creates chances with his speed. Far from plug and play, he is a work in project as a puck carrier. One of the younger players in the class. Has room to put weight on his frame. Needs more experience on the attack and his decision making when he has it. Needs to control the biscuit better."
27,2014,Nikolay Goldobin,"Import player who seems to have all the offensive skills to be a very successful NHL down the road. Undeniable weapon who can dangle, set up and score, putting defenders on their heals. Sneaks into the soft areas and lets go with a lethal shot. Lost in his own zone, and needs plenty more strength and commitment to be a better back-end player. The fact that Ilya Kovalchuk walked away from his NHL career to easily find a new buyer in the KHL further complicates the NHL decision in regards to drafting skilled Russian-born prospects, including those who have shown the willingness to come over in the season prior to their draft year."
35,2014,Dominik Masin,"Hard-nosed defensive defenseman who is positional strong and aggressive playing inside his limits to stop attackers. At this juncture, is only middle of the road in terms of passing, carrying, and mobility. He manages to do a solid job blocking shots, handling one on ones, clearing the crease, and sealing the opposition on the boards. He takes pucks away and reads play well. Hits with authority and makes the play out of the zone well. It is a question as to whether teams see a significant upside."
26,2014,Nikita Scherbak,"Virtual unknown, who came over to the WHL via the import draft without high importance or consideration by the higher ups in his Native Russian, where he had never considered as a player for their international competition teams.  A tall and bigger framed forward, far from a finished product, but one that moves well, has a good stick, and good touch,and displays high IQ offensive attack savvy. True top end puck skills, and outstanding touch as he passes the puck. Shows a willingness to get to the front and has no anxiety in the battle zones. Raw sleeper who may catch the eye of an NHL team fairly early."
30,2014,John Quenneville,"Big centreman with good transistion skills, patient distributor with a long stride that helps him stay in  option on the attack ands in support. Displays lateral quickness and is a deceptive shooter. Has long arms, and big frame that can carry more muscle and thickness. Keeps his feet moving on carries and has a good release. Is good on the forecheck, in transition and finishes with a snapshot from the perimeter. Plays for an in-experienced club and has been a solid player and producer who projects as long term project that may eventually flourish into a top six pro."
25,2014,David Pastrnak,"Smaller wing/centre who has great feet and hands and tons of dangle and nose for the net. Really good when he has the puck and handles it whether he has open space or under pressure. One-on-one he is a joy to watch, as he seems to have a holster full of moves that thwart defenders. Drives the lanes aggressively and is good in traffic. Displays a quick release and rocket shot that catches goalies by surprise. Not a burner North-South or great defensively yet, but he moves quickly laterally and turns and jukes and provides plenty of excitement for those in the seats. He was selected to the roster for the World Junior Under-18 Tournament in April, 2013."
31,2014,Brendan Lemieux,"Son of Claude Lemieux. Not fancy, just a big meat and potatoes North-South wing who can get going a bowl over the defenders on the way. Very thick and still developing strength, but a fearless and always ready combatant if it is necessary. Always good in his end taking pucks back on the wall and safely getting them to the proper outlet. A developing player who may rise up the charts as a first rounder if he continues to show he has the makings of a power forward. And in his past two junior playoff years, he seemed to elevate his game when the chips were down."
22,2014,Kasperi Kapanen,"He was selected to the roster for the World Junior Under-18 Tournament in April. Saw time on the Finnish first line, where he did set up a few scoring chances and also display good responsible work in his own zone. Son of Sami. His Bloodline will call on many scouts to make decisions on just where he fits on their draft boards. So far he looks like a long term project that has some abilities but is still a bit tentative in his play, unwilling to pay the price to make the play."
23,2014,Conner Bleackley,"PP centreman who already is physically developed and displays a knack when he has the puck on his stick. Not the quickest player, but does move powerfully when he keeps the legs moving.  He is a nice player, just not one that explodes as a top flight offensive prospect. He could, though, develop into a shutdown forward. Can use his size to his advantage on the opposition. Needs to improve his stop/starts, and continue to the defensive commitment and his play away from the puck that his Coach Brent Sutter has instilled. Makes good passes. Has a heavy shot but needs to improve his release time. He must spend more time moving his legs instead of coasting and waiting for things to happen in both the offensive and defensive zones."
19,2014,Anthony DeAngelo,"Elusive undersized defenseman with a calm demeanor, great wheels, and an really quick stick. A riverboat gambler with exceptional puck skills and lightning hard shot. Game changing talent from the back-line where he has great vision soft hands and the ability to make space. The issue teams will have with him is he hasn't been a very good teammate and that attitude had him sitting out for a bit."
18,2014,Alex Tuch,"Big wing who is good on his edges and gets to the net. Offensively has a good skill set, with hands that let go a quick hard shot. Can power to the front and is stong on his carries, using his reach to control the biscuit. Needs to get a bit quicker, and is still raw and needs further development. Certainly a lot to like as he keeps  getting better."
16,2014,Sonny Milano,"Almost six foot winger who is creative on the offense, despite not being a quick strike attacker. Has really excellent hands and makes plays with his stick and movement, while reading the ice for the best option. Smooth stick handler who makes whomever are his linemates a tad better without a need for adjustment time. Plays at top speed  and loves to attack and provide scoring chances for teammates. Committed to Boston College."
21,2014,Robbie Fabbri,"A highly advanced offensive player who understands the attack zone and has a great feel and passion in occupying it. Is a strong skater who stays on track due to his skating base and plays not only strong on the puck but on the forecheck to unearth it.  Tremendous short area burst. Creates chances with good anticipation, soft hands and absolute fearlessness against larger players. If he gets bigger and stronger, some team may draft a huge competitor who already has a two way game and strong back check. Fearless."
20,2014,Nick Schmaltz,"Longer term project who is not the sum of his parts. Displays good feet, vision, hands of the high end level, but his work ethic is on the low end. Needs to become an all around team first player, one who helps his team get chances, and not wait for the team around him to provide him with scoring chances. Takes many a shift off, and can disappear in a tight checking game. The question remains will the team that drafts him see the dazzling skill and motor for 60 minutes? Was named to the U.S. World Junior A roster for the Junior A Challenge. Committed to North Dakota University."
17,2014,Travis Sanheim,"Big rangy Western league defender with size, skill, feet, puck skills and shot."
14,2014,Julius Honka,"Small defender who plays much bigger than his size. Fearless, and will engage anyone to get control of the puck."
24,2014,Jared McCann,"Fearless six foot centre with very good mobility, agility, and gears. Plays strong on the puck and has impressive vision, hands, stick-handling skills and passing ability while in flight. Can play in tight and quickly jump into the open areas and get off strong shots. Good hockey IQ in all three zones, and quick to come back in transition. Takes care of his own end and is fearless in puck battles at both ends. He is unafraid in the battle zones and wall to make plays and work for pucks. Has a quick stick, and accurate passing skills. A strong competitor who will give a good showing each night."
11,2014,Kevin Fiala,"Swiss-born Czech prospect is a soft touch passer with scoring prowess, and some jam. Can finish, has a willingness to go get the puck back due to his balance and quickness. Good in tight and a brilliant puck handler, and smart and accurate when dishing it off."
15,2014,Dylan Larkin,"Two-way player at the centre position who displays excellent balance and jump all over the 200 foot sheet. Sees the ice well and makes plays in the offensive zone with both skill and grit. Plays strong on the puck and shows some snarl in the battle zones. Displays soft hands and sets up a whole lot of chances for his linemates. Very responsible in his defensive zone. Smart and aware on the attack, and deceptively quick."
10,2014,Nick Ritchie,"Tough and quick, he is a good playmaker and scorer. Strong on the forecheck and in the battle areas. 200lber with great size, good on-ice vision soft mitts, quick release and natural goal scoring instincts. Working to be a stronger forechecker, and improve as a two-way player. Already displays skill and physical presence. Aggressive physical player with good agility and footwork. Punishing hitter. Emerging offensive player who is difficult to move off the puck. Uses his core strength and skating strides to cause problems defending. It would be no surprise to me if he leapfrogged higher ranked prospects and went even higher. He was selected to the roster for the World Junior Under-18 Tournament in April, 2013."
9,2014,Nikolaj Ehlers,"A Danish blazer who has high end acceleration and a set of gears. One of the best skaters in this draft. Fearless in traffic. Possesses an excellent wrist shot. Can makes plays while moving at his top gear. A bit undersized, but developing in all phases. A member of his homeland’s team roster for the World Junior Under-20 at Christmas 2014."
12,2014,Brendan Perlini,"A bigger man with great skating ability, good hockey IQ, a long reach, and strong skating stride. Plays strong on the puck, and has displayed considerable scoring ability in the early going, and went on to have career offensive totals while playing a 200 foot game. Is a very effective forechecker,and is always around the puck.  Lanky and has room to fill out."
7,2014,Haydn Fleury,"Big framed physical defenseman who combines good feet, offensive upside with solid defense. Very composed defender with a poise & calm, a good stick, and some aggression in his own zone. Makes solid contact, and his reach helps break up attacks. He is a solid transition passer, and his skating ability makes him good going back up-ice. Has plenty of room to get bigger and stronger. Watching him as an attacker is why teams are hoping he is on the board when they are picking. He patrols the right point as threat in many ways. His skating ability and balance might have him walk the blue line, and thread the needle with a pass to a forward on the half wall, or take the shot as things open. He is good at holding pucks in on the pinch, and his long reach lets him place them in on the attack effectively. A promising prospect that will get bigger and play strong minutes on a NHL team's defensive pairing. Exactly which pairing he projects to will be determined as he advances."
8,2014,William Nylander,"Small lightweight centre who upper level skills will see him being selected fairly early. He may never have a physical side, but he makes up for it with a other aspects that push him close elite level on the offensive end. Possesses top end gears, and lateral agility. Has great hands and could stickhandle in a phone book. Is both a good shooter and passer. Displays a quick release and pin-point passing accuracy. Son of former NHLer Michael Nylander. He was selected to the roster for the World Junior Under-18 Tournament in April, 2013."
6,2014,Jake Virtanen,"Physically punishing forward who skates really well with top speed. He goes to the net with abandon, and scores a lot inside the circles. Ultra-aggressive stronger skating attacker who can make plays at top speed, dangle though defenders one on one, and create havoc in the battle areas. Displays a really good release and shot who jumps out at you when you watch him."
5,2014,Michael Dal Colle,"Big bodied forward who plays strong on the puck with very good hands, balance, and power to his stride. Life-long centre currently being asked to play wing. he is good along the wall and clogs the front in anticipation of teammate's shots. Good passer with a longer reach and solid in his own zone. Solid 200 foot player whose frame looks to get thicker and make him even more of a load on the wall and in the slot. Far from the finished product, but reads the ice well and distributes the puck well on the attack. Final rank will be closely tied with how he develops by the draft."
3,2014,Leon Draisaitl,"German import who is his second season in the ""dub"" adjusting to the North American style, which his seems tailor-made for his big-framed offensively aggressive style. Not a fighter or pounder, but plays to his size as offensive playmaking centre-wing. He will strat as a centre but may find time as a wing. Displays good balance and plays strong on the puck. A good set-up man who also can quickly get off the puck too. He may need to continue improving his speed and add strength to make even bigger impact. A North-South skater who does have decent stick-handling skills. He is tall and will get thicker. Projects as a top ten pick early on. He was selected to the roster for the World Junior Under-18 Tournament in April, 2013."
13,2014,Jakub Vrana,"Has been on the radar for several seasons as his skill level has always been evident. He was selected to the roster for the World Junior Under-18 Tournament in April. A dynamic player who despite his smaller size, is an impact player capable of getting dirty and competing against all comers. Displays great vision, IQ and feel for the attack. A flyer with first step quickness, who plays strong on the puck, and excellent puck-handling skills and lateral mobility. Will need to get even stronger but he has deceptive array of shots, and excellent set-up skills, and goes to the battle areas with reluctance at his present size and strength. A very creative offensive generator who can find a teammate or bring the fans out of their seats with his sudden offensive forays. The question might be can he stay focused and give 100% effort for sixty minutes. Again being a elite player in Czech, he hasn't developed the strong defensive commitment he will need in the North American game. It just isn't there yet. A member of his homeland’s team roster for the World Junior Under-20 at Christmas 2014."
4,2014,Sam Bennett,"A centre-wing with great foot speed, skills and edge. Can score and generate offense, but also forecheck with opposing players shaken when he is coming. In open ice, his acceleration gives him even more respect and he is an excellent one-on-one attacker. He will get stronger and maybe bigger. His compete style and versatility have him on the board as a possible first overall. He was selected to the roster for the World Junior Under-18 Tournament in April, 2013."
1,2014,Aaron Ekblad,"Ekblad is another prospect who has taken a ton of criticism for looking ""ordinary."" Big defenders seem to always look like they are lumbering (not standing out as a ""flash and dash"" players,) even while playing solid. Plays big, calm, and poised. Shows physicality, and can dominate, because he is bigger than most opponents. Excellent transition passer,and has a hard point shot. A good balanced skater who has improved his lateral agility, which will help close gaps. With big men, you usually wait for the feet to catch up with the body. When his do, you may see an improving offensive game. It is easy to overlook the lack of wow factor with him when you realize you are getting a huge defender who will play in the bigs. Panic-free big defender with agility, great skating ability, and controlled play. Size, skill, smarts and hockey sense and plays all phases so well. Has a great stick, and is excellent in transition and a fine long passer.Has size, skill, smarts and hockey sense. Plays all phases so well."
2,2014,Sam Reinhart,"Bloodlines are where Sam Reinhardt's resume start. His father,Paul, played in the NHL, and his two brothers have already been drafted, and he could turn out to be the best of the bunch. Critics may try to dissect his skating, his physical strength and size, but he is an all-around impact player with vision, excellent playmaking skills, and some grit.  Great hockey IQ and diagnoses things so well in the attack zone. Is quietly developing a strong 200 foot game and has a quick stick, good lateral quickness and good diagnostic skills. Good on the wall. A strong set-up man who understands the attack zone but also can score. Goods hands, agility, offensive skills, and exceptional on-ice vision. Not super quick but reads and reacts in all zones. Displays a quick stick, and good on the wall. Not the biggest guy, but unafraid to hold his own against most opponents. He was selected to the roster for the World Junior Under-18 Tournament in April, 2013. Projects as a top six centre-wing."
206,2011,Garrett Haar,"Committed to developing his game at Northeastern University, as he is a work in progress."
202,2011,Max Everson,"Smooth skating defenseman project who can be general in his play going up ice. He has to learn the subtleties of positioning in his own zone, and must get stronger, but already displays advanced puck control and makes the kinds of passes and plays NHL defenseman are now asked to make with regularity."
204,2011,Alexei Marchenko,"Big, prototypical Russian defenseman who can play all phases and skate well against the better opponents. A blood disorder slowed him this season, and if he was a bit more physical, he could be special. Wonderful lateral mobility and excellent passer with great hands to receive them too. Smart all over the ice, strong in front of his nets, and solid in all phases. Good passer and team guy. Solid balanced skater who sees the ice well, jumps up in transition, shows offensive patience, and is gifted with soft hands for receiving and dishing the puck."
200,2011,Matt Peca,"Bloodlines have produced a high energy wing who is a fearless, skilled, small wing on a Tier two team. Can play any line in any role. He handles a point on the PP and is an excellent penalty killer. Did he inherit the hands from daddy Mike?"
195,2011,Zac Larraza,"Arizona-born long term forward project. Has enough skill to finish and has size. An effective fore-checker. His time with the Pioneers will be spent honing his positioning, hockey IQ, and offensive decision-making."
190,2011,Tyler Graovac,"Missed the playoffs with a broken arm, and although he has not yet played like his size, he has good skating ability. Once he bulks up a bit, he may play with more grit."
197,2011,Colin Sullivan,"Solid defensive game, great speed and balance. Has a nice point shot and will jump in to the rush, but presently his abilities in his own end are his strength."
182,2011,Dillion Donnelly,"Son of former NHL'er Gord, has shown some puck skills and a whole lot of nastiness. He will have to take a developmental leap though to be groomed as 6 - 7 pro defenseman."
180,2011,Lars Volden,Also the second time around for this Norwegian goaltender...
178,2011,Dylan Demelo,Aggressive defenseman with good offensive skills and demeanor. He needs to grow bigger and refine his decision-making allowing himself to be patient when in the attack. Has a good shot. Strength will determine whether he can improve enough to reach higher levels.
176,2011,Travis Boyd,"Quick, good-handed player whose size may determine whether he gets a chosen or not. He needs weight room time and a couple of inches worth of growth wouldn't hurt either."
175,2011,Petr Placek,"Czech import who is a high schooler in the United States with big time size and shot. Scouts expected him to blossom against the smaller high schoolers and dominate in not only puck battles, but with advanced impact scoring.  His year saw injuries and a strong offensive game that has not reached a level where the opposition views him as dominant force. Would be going higher if his injury hadn't cut down the views of his soft hands and stick, and if his deadly shot had made the back of the net a bit more. Needs to add a first step to his accretion. Teams will be patient to watch if his development can take the next step at the college level."
174,2011,Richard Nedomlel,"So far has been passed on in two draft years, due to the fact that he had the tools, but the toolbox was considered empty. Has the size, but is lacking a first step and his stride is short. He is not balanced or agile. Once moving he can create separation against defenders and passes the puck well in traffic. Good wall game. The transfer from the Czech Republic to the Wheatkings  did show a more physical side emerge. Regardless of his negatives, he has a strong quick stick and good hands, but needs consistency along with better skating technique."
171,2011,Peter Ceresnak,"Physical hard hitting stay-at-home defender, who has a hard point shot. Makes a nice first pass, and even more importantly is a terrific wall player. His game needs improving at both ends, as does his foot speed. More of a North-South skater but is improving laterally. He has good balance, but he needs work to become a better thinker in his own end, and maybe develop his attacking skills."
167,2011,Daniel Pribyl,"Rising prospect with good puck abilities, and scoring prowess who needs to continue to work on his skating. He continues to develop defensively with the hope that he is that big two-way up and down winger every club looks for."
163,2011,Laurent Brossoit,You have to wonder how that fluke Red Deer goal he let in will affect his draft status…Nonetheless thus kid doesn't look like a quitter.
162,2011,Matthew Mahalak,An ice-water player whose game is still in development. He is an intriguing long term prospect though between the pipes.
160,2011,Stephen Michalek,"Calm, silver medal winning goalie from Ivan Hlinka tourney who has physical gifts."
156,2011,Jason Kasdorf,Lanky netminder has led his team to the Manitoba Junior playoffs and shot up the CSC lists into the top ten.
161,2011,Ryan Tesink,"Undersized two-way wing who has hockey smarts, good vision, feet, and offensive skills. He lead Team Atlantic in scoring at the 2010 World Under-17 Hockey Challenge with 6 points in 5 games."
154,2011,Andy Fritsch,"Quick-footed, scoring wing who is improving his defensive coverages and wall work. Good head for the attack zone and is a good long term prospect."
151,2011,Dave Broll,Tough wing who was part of Canada's Ivan Hlinka tourney team. Stands up for teammates. He is good balanced skater who will need to work on increasing his speed and production.
158,2011,Reece Scarlett,"More of a long term project and is learning in all facets. Is a smart youngster with the chance of being a two-way defenseman. Needs to build his body far past his present size. He certainly can position himself very well, and has nice lateral ability. Very mobile player who distributes the puck well, and easily slips out of his defensive zone when pressured. He pivots and jumps into the empty spaces no matter if there are 270 degrees turnabouts. He could be a gem if he starts polishing up. He plays big, although his present size may hamper his chances. He may be able to grow larger than his present defense-first style, and might blossom."
146,2011,Patrick Koudys,"Hard working, smart, and skilled long term project, who has good North-South speed, and room for growth on his frame. Plenty of upside when his feet catch up to his growing body."
153,2011,Eddie Wittchow,"Physical high school D-man who can score as well as a forward. He has come out of relative absurdity to capture a spot in the draft's top three rounds. He has excellent mobility and a whole lot of nasty. A Minnesota All-Stater, he scored 13 goals displaying a shot, speed, smarts and snarl. May decide to attend Wisconsin, his parent's alma mater. A long-term project that could be real sleeper."
148,2011,Austen Brassard,"Big three zone winger who has some power game, and is very active all over the ice. If his scoring production was better, it would help him on draft day.  Presently teams will view him with limited offensive prowess, and maybe has enough jam to compensate for it. A good balanced skater who will need to work on increasing his speed, but he gets there, plays good defense, and will be worth a selection."
150,2011,Rob O'Gara,"Rising prep school prospect who competes at a high level and is improving all aspects of his game. He is this long drink of water now, but as he fills in and gets better coordinated there is certainly hope he can become an NHLer."
142,2011,Max Friberg,"If you draft him here, what you see if what you get. Don't expect any more than a guy who can be a fireplug of a disruptor who has good hands, a good stick, and good speed. He is pretty much developed and will bring an aggressive forecheck and will finish checks."
144,2011,Philippe Hudon,"Another Czech import with size, speed, and hands. At his present level, he displays a snap shot, and if he wanted, could be a difficult load to handle if some snarl appeared. Needs to learn the attack zone better and employ his body, fast feet, quick stick, and passing abilities in unison with the work of his teammates."
134,2011,Troy Vance,"Big, punishing defender who loves to hit the attackers whether they are in open ice or on the wall. A New York state native raised 40 miles out of NYC, who played in the Philly area until he brought his game to Victoriaville. Skates well for a big man and doesn't embarrass himself when he carries the puck."
133,2011,Shane McColgan,"This California-born skilled, smaller wing, plays fearlessly as a Kelowna Rocket with a great speed/skill ratio puck and does so at top end speed, maybe faster than anyone in this draft class. Has a nice snap shot, and passes well, but what sets him apart is the quick first step and the gears. Not big, and needs heaps of weight-room strength. Never the less, he brings all he does have in the attack zone."
139,2011,Joel Lowry,Hard driving winger who leads by never taking a shift off.
135,2011,Samuel Noreau,"Strong man-mountain fist-fighter who might round out a pro lineup if his feet catch up to his size. Outright nasty, he is a shutdown guy who needs his footwork to improve."
128,2011,Logan Pietila,Committed to Michigan Tech.
132,2011,Sean Kuraly,"Long shot due to lack of good hands & puck skills, and is only a decent skater at this juncture, but plays big."
127,2011,Seth Ambroz,"Big wing who will do the dirty work to unearth pucks in the battle zones, take hits, stand in front, and show prowess below the hash marks. Not the best skater but has balance and fair speed. Needs to be more of a player along the wall, and give a better effort away from the puck. Combined with good hand/eye coordination, vision, solid passing skills, and a quick release hard wrister, there is lots to like."
211,2012,Nick Ebert,"Projects as a number one two-way defender whose size, cool demeanor, vision, and feet will let him contribute both offensively and defensively. By far the best American born prospect in this draft. Plays defense with plenty of nastiness and was well respected in the OHL as a 16 year old in 2010-11. Much has been made of his ""immaturity"" for not using the summer as an intense preparation period for his draft year, and many felt he was out of shape. This impacted his performance and the larger role that had been planned for him earlier this campaign. It took him awhile to return to the level of play he had displayed at the 2010-11 season's end."
207,2012,Matthew Beattie,"New Jersey native is a tall sniper who shows offensive prowess, stick skills, and soft hands. Needs improved defensive play, game strength, skating, and compete level."
202,2012,Nikita Gusev,3rd yr. eligible Russian speed wing who again showed his prowess in the World Junior Tournament. A player who may be ready for NHL duty much sooner than the rest.
208,2012,Justin Haché,"Raw Quebec-league defender who is still learning to use his body and hone his offensive & defensive talents. He is playing on a deep veteran Shawinigan team, so sees less ice than if he played elsewhere. So far a defense-first defender who has a quick stick and uses it to break up plays. Needs time and experience. Already has a nice stretch pass, but he is a long term developer."
206,2012,Tyrel Seaman,"Rising player who plays center but projects well as an NHL winger. He displays improving puck skills, and the ability to develop into a stand-in-front PP presence. A strong skating forward who has a solid developed frame and plays to his size. An aggressive player, good skater, good stick-handler whose offensive game may continue to grow."
201,2012,Valeri Vasiliyev,"Raw Russian prospect who has good feet, although average in traffic, good lateral mobility, and terrific balance and pivoting ability. Stockily built, he is tank-like in his hits on attackers in front and on the wall. Plays with a bit of nasty for 60 minutes. What will be called in to question is whether he will be able to progress in the other phases of his defensive game, and in his understanding of positioning. Loves contact but loses sight of his job out there."
204,2012,Judd Peterson,"A big man who skates extremely well and has excellent acceleration for a kid his size. Far from ready, he needs to be more aggressisve, smarter with the puck, and add more shot development."
198,2012,Joakim Ryan,"A dynamic two-way defenseman who can QB the power play, and seems two feet above the competition in his anticipation, vision, and poise. Strong skater. His dual citizenship allowed him to play for Sweden in the World Under-17 Hockey Challenge at Christmas. His mother is former tennis star Catarina Lundqvist."
196,2012,Mikael Wikstrand,"Solid two way defender who never looks out of position and plays a smart game. He will need weight training, but already has excellent skating abilities and balance. Is an above average PP general, who knows where to distribute. Moves effortlessly along the blue line laterally, which helps to open the scoring lanes. An excellent long term prospect and value in the later rounds of this draft."
194,2012,Jonatan Nielsen,Huge tall defender who has skill and feet. He needs time to develop and get more opportunities to improve.
191,2012,Brandon Whitney,"Brandon is a large, athletic goaltender who covers a large portion of the net. He will need to polish his positioning, but with his raw talent and size, he should be a fast riser in the rankings. Playing for Atlantic at the World Under-17 Hockey Challenge, he stared as Team Atlantic upset Team West in the fifth place game and outplayed top goaltending prospect from the QMJHL, Francois Tremblay."
195,2012,Christian Djoos,"Far from the finished product,this under 6 foot defenseman is an excellent stickhandler and smart with puck distribution. Excellent PP guy. Makes the long stretch pass. His skating leaves much room for improvement, and improved leg strength will help a bit with that. Won Minnesota's Mr Hockey award. His father played pro hockey."
192,2012,Colin Smith,"Undrafted last year, he already had over 75 points prior to March 2012. Strong competitor with speed and playmaking skills."
197,2012,Jaynen Rissling,"Rangy, physically mature defender who is defense-first, but also shoots and passes well enough to get PP time. Uses his body to punish attackers, and pretty much maintains good positioning in the defensive zone. Has some offensive game and a big shot. He plays in all situations and looks like a good developing prospect."
121,2011,Martin Gernat,"Developing, big defender has decent feet and lateral agility in addition to good puck skills. Lacks tempered aggression and needs to play to his size. Needs to improve his skating balance and puck movement in the heat of pressure."
189,2012,Brendan Collier,"Named by ESPN Boston as Mr. Hockey, he was a team leader, who has keen offensive skills and is committed to all three zones.  He scored 27 goals, 64 points in 22 games on his way to overtime Super Eight championship winning goal. He has committed to Boston University."
122,2011,Garrett Meurs,"Part three of the Whalers big line. Hard working competitor who plays with jam all over the offensive zone. Opportunistic in the area between the circles and seems to score on rebounds with his hard snapper. Good wall player. Average hands, average feet, but a hard worker who seems to like to do a bit of talking to the enemy."
118,2011,Zachary Yuen,Works as a shutdown defender with some up-ice offensive abilities.
116,2011,Steffen Soberg,"Smaller goalie with a big glove, good movement, superb agility & reflexes. A strong low game whose play was the highlight of the World Under-18 tournament."
115,2011,Colin Suellentrop,Florida-born defender played with Detroit Compuware in midget and posted an impressive 21+/- with the Generals and was a key player in their playoff run. A stay-at-home defender that uses his body on the wall and in front. Makes the good first pass and is a good skater with mobility. Will never be a huge attacker. He will quietly be an effective player at the things he does best.
113,2011,Tobias Rieder,"As the NHL starts seeing more and more German players, teams will give closer attention to players who in time, may compete for NHL roster spots. Rieder fits the category of a long term prospect who needs plenty of growth, strength, and fill-in, but already exhibits very good puck-handling skills, pass and play-making abilities, as well as a willingness to be involved in the play with gusto."
117,2011,Marcel Noebels,"2010 eligible German import who does not display a lot of jump, but certainly gets there and does work the offensive zone well. He sees the ice well, and has a lot of skill and smarts. His wide body makes him dangerous as he goes to the net. He sees the ice well and is an effective jam player in deep. Huge forward with a good dangle and the potential to be an NHL forward. Shows agility but is raw due and needs time to get stronger, fill-in and get a bit more coordinated, balanced, and hungry."
110,2011,Kale Kessy,"He was not invited to the scouting combine possibly because of his age. This undrafted 19  1/2 year old had an early injury, but eventually showed he had an offensive game to coincide with his sturdly built and super-tough play. He has been drawing comparisons to former Western Leaguer Milan Lucic. He is far from close to this comparison, but does have an untapped skill set and is an improving all-around player besides being a real fist-fighter."
107,2011,Olivier Archambault,"Undersized RW who is weak defensively, but displays some offensive quickness and flair."
108,2011,Maxim Shalunov,"Boom or Bust Russian giant who clearly exhibits strong attacking abilities with superb acceleration, strong on the puck, a quick release, soft hands, and a big frame that easily could win pucks in the battle areas, if he had the game in/game out willingness to do so. He has a shot, and all the tools. It will either come together for him with on-ice hard work or he will never see the North American shores."
106,2011,Colin Jacobs,"Projects as a strong skating center with good jump in his stride. A playmaker who passes the puck well and plays at times close to the edge. He is learning to be a better defensive center, and is committed to all-around improvement of his game, including his shot and offensive abilities."
109,2011,Michael Mersch,"From the Chicago Suburb of Park Ridge, he has showed improvement starting with the 2009 World U-17's, and led the Wisconsin team with a plus 23."
105,2011,Michael St. Croix,"Undersized opportunistic scorer with great stick skills and superb vision, as well as some jump. Good hands and big play ability. Very Good Hockey IQ when diagnosing the ice. He must improve in all phases. It remains to be seen if he can become a stronger player with a 60-minute involvement."
102,2011,Gregory Hofmann,Plays for Ambri Piotta
98,2011,Reid Boucher,"Undersized wing with good speed and net drive, where he understands body positioning. Has goal scoring ability and makes chances with his hands and can finish. If you asked the US developmental squad who their scorer is, I am pretty sure many would call out his name."
97,2011,Mike Reilly,Mighty mite with good offensive skills who comes from a family of hockey players.
114,2011,Marek Tvrdon,"Injured much of the season, but in his brief season he showed he had a wicked wrister, good hands, and impressive strength to go along with his size."
100,2011,Joseph Labate,"Projects as a solid big forward when he adds size to his already wide-bodied frame. He has a real nice quick & heavy shot, and uses the size he already has to his advantage in front and in the battle areas."
92,2011,Joachim Nermark,"Hard working two-way center with good touch. Not a burner but makes up for it with leg drive and creativity with the puck. Solid in all phases, he is a threat whether he shoots or passes, because he always seems to be moving towards the net on offense. One of the better players at the 8 Nations Tourney"
96,2011,Josiah Didier,"Wasn't drafted last year, but his additional college time has caused improvement in this Colorado native's game. Skates and moves well. His arms let him use his stick to clog passing lanes. Added some jam to his play. Besides a tougher style he continues to improve in judgement, skating, and offensive acumen."
91,2011,Dillon Simpson,"Limited minutes/exposure on the talent filled ND defense makes evaluating him a bit tough, but he won't last much longer. He is an effortless skater who has not rounded out his game at this point, but has shown glimpses of solid performances at both ends of the ice."
94,2011,Robbie Russo,"Plays his position effectively and has no apparent weaknesses in his ability to move the puck up-ice. He isn't the best skater so he will have to improve to move to the higher levels. He is not big, but is very cool in action, and has a knack for getting the biscuit to go where he wants it to. Size may limit his upside, and he is going to have to improve in all phases to be effective."
83,2011,Harrison Ruopp,Developing open-ice hitter and physical presence.
82,2011,Andy Welinski,"Rugged, balanced skating defenseman who's learning to improve his decisions on both ends. Long term project that could develop into a tough defender."
88,2011,Justin Sefton,Big defender who seeks out opportunities to throw big hits and punches. He also shows an offensive side.
81,2011,Nick Shore,Scorer with an accurate shot that he needs little room to launch.
87,2011,Jordon Binnington,"It took a hip injury to first-string goalie, Scott Stajer, in order for Binnington to show the scouts he could be the real deal. Still needs reps, but displays good tracking, strong home plate, and quick movement ability."
86,2011,Jonathan Racine,"Projects as a good passing, solid hitting defender who doesn't panic in his own end. Mobile and able to jump up or simply make the safe outlet pass. He is a work in progress"
76,2011,Daniel Catenacci,"Undersized fireball with great stick skills, superb vision, and speed.  Every time he steps on the ice he reminds me of the when Lou Angotti was thrown on the ice for a short shift, and he relentlessly went full speed the entire time, trying to make an explosive impact. He was able to since he was taking not a regular shift. You have to wonder how effective this lad would be as the level of competition rises and everyone naturally moves at a higher quickness level."
85,2011,Joshua Leivo,"Potential power forward, who skates well and makes space for his linemates. Finally showed in the playoffs that he could have latent offensive ability."
78,2011,Klas Dahlbeck,"Big, fluid defensive prospect who has shown marked improvement since being eligible last year."
75,2011,Logan Shaw,Tall wing who after three seasons showed some offensive skill on a weaker squad. He skates well and has shown he can score and create.
72,2011,Keegan Lowe,"Developing effective two-way defender who goes unnoticed due to his solid error-free play. He has a quick stick and will stand up for teammates. It helps to have a Father who was an Edmonton great. He needs to get stronger in the legs but has shown he can handle defensive coverage, control gaps, and safely outlet the puck. Another work in progress who may be a gem."
71,2011,Steven Fogarty,Long term project who needs to work to get his feet to move faster. Understands the game and the attack and is a good offense generator who also needs to get more involved in the attack zone. He is solid defensively and strong on the puck once moving.
69,2011,Michael Paliotta,"Physical long-armed rearguard who is a really strong skater for his size. Great lateral ability besides North & South. If he could develop an edge it would be to his advantage as he seems to be balanced enough to stay in control when he does play aggressively. He does close but many times avoids the thump he could lay on attackers. Plays a safe game in his zone as he hasn't become an effective up-ice guy, but may when he becomes more effective in handling the puck."
68,2011,Nick Cousins,"Undersized center-wing but a solid performer on a struggling OHL team. Another player who showed at the World U-18s that he was smart and opportunistic, and could play on any line in any role. Good check and penalty-killer. A guy you select and then ""wait and see."""
66,2011,T.J. Tynan,"Chicago area prospect who was named National College Hockey Rookie of the Year after leading all college freshman with 23 goals and 31 assists for 54 points, including 16 multi-point games. Was eligible in 2010, but teams were leery of his size."
77,2011,Brennan Serville,"Tall, lanky mobile defender with good balance who has puck skills and up-ice strenghts. Played in the Under-17's challenge on the Canada East roster and has changed his college commitment to the University of Michigan."
73,2011,Travis Ewanyk,"Relentless banging center who wins face-offs, finishes checks and does all the gritty things you need to win. Has a powerful stride, and is well balanced and technically strong. Goes 100% all the time, and while he may have limited offensive upside, he can make a team based on his shut-down and PK abilities."
70,2011,David Honzik,"Big, quick-legged goalie who is a butterfly 'tender with agility and good rebound control. Moves well laterally, and stays square on the shooter. Good long term prospect."
67,2011,Adam Lowry,"Dave Lowry's son is a work in progress. The size is there, but the skating balance, strength, and snarl need tweaking. A big guy who will get bigger. Plays with jam. The wall is where he works, and with continued filling out and work on his skating, he could be a great player."
63,2011,Andrei Pedan,"Strong skating big man who is very well co-ordinated at a younger age. He seems naturally balanced and smooth in his stride, and able to control the gaps due to his lateral skating prowess. Also has a long reach, and smarts. Wins collisions against most opposing players. Good skill package and a huge upside, that is if we can use his showing in the OHL as a starting point in the long road to the NHL. So far he keeps it simple, being more of a decent outlet pass guy, but has puck skills enough to carry the mail."
64,2011,Vincent Trocheck,"Good puck abilities, and scoring prowess. Has some quickness and digs in. Big three-zone winger who has some power game, is very active all over the ice. If his scoring production was better, it would help him on draft day.  Presently teams will view him with limited offensive prowess, and maybe lacking in enough jam to compensate for it. A good balanced skater who will need to work on increasing his speed, but he gets there, plays good defense, and will be worth a selection."
60,2011,Mario Lucia,"Daddy is the head coach at the U. of Minnesota. Sonny boy has keen skating abilities, nice hands, and a nice skill set. Looks like a player already, and has a high on ice IQ. May be the best player in Minnesota high school."
61,2011,Shane Prince,"Dark horse prospect who displays excellent skills with the puck and his stick. His superb skating and compete level combine to make him a player who will get his name called early in June. Great transition player, defensively-able, and can even kill penalties. A late season concussion is what pushed him out of the mid-first round. With a full recovery though, some team gets a big-time offensive present."
186,2012,Matt Deblouw,Just hitting his stride after a major injury last year where he lacerated his spleen while delivering a big-time hit.  Plays a strong two-way game. Committed to Michigan State University.
187,2012,Kenton Helgesen,"Played both left wing and defense in the past, as he has very good speed and puck skills. Will stand up for himself and drops the mitts whenever necessary. Raw developing physical pounder on D with big time strength already."
185,2012,Jake Bischoff,"Developing prospect with a good overall game. Has an active stick, some up-ice puck movement, and good balance. His skating stride needs work, and he will need time to develop. Good recognition skills and overall savvy. He has verbally committed to the University of Minnesota."
184,2012,Marek Langhammer,"Butterfly goalie with a quick glove and strong athletic ability. Has quick reflexes, fast legs, good lateral movement, solid rebound control, good positioning, and great recovery ability. Calm when the attack is strong and drives when taking shooters on. Very lean and had no formal goaltending coach until four seasons ago. Intriguing goalie prospect."
62,2011,Samu Perhonen,"Big, quick-legged Finn goaler who gives little net to shoot at. He moves very well, stays in the play and competes like he is going to win every game. Was instrumental in the Finland win over Sweden at the Four Nations last November."
182,2012,Gianluca Curcurto,"In the draft year where so many defenseman were already projected to be solid NHL mainstays, comes a player who equals many of the D-men all slotted before him. He reads situations very well, and is consistently efficient as a reliable shut-down defender. Not a guy who stands out with flash or dash. Just a smart player who stays within his abilities to be a very good two-way defenseman. Has nice size and a wide skating base. Not overly physical but puts himself in good position and has an active stick to break up offensive flurries. Terrific footwork. Never does too much, and plays with an ability to know when to slow things down or speed things up. A good outlet passer who never wilts when pressured and a nice point man on offense. Plays strong on his skates, moves well laterally on the blue line, and is a decent set up man. Needs to use his big-time shot more. Has many attributes that will be attractive to NHL teams as he has upside. At the CHL Prospects game, he won the event tiebreaker as the player wtih the most accurate shot, edging out Scott Laughton."
65,2011,Joseph Cramarossa,"A gritty, still developing forward who is starting to use his size, speed, and grit."
180,2012,Artur Gavrus,"Speedy, smaller player who finds hole and gets open using his skating prowess. His two-way game is a work in progress for this Belarusian import."
178,2012,"Samuel ""Hunter"" Fejes","Anchorage, Alaska native is a left wing who plays as a power player down low. Has scoring ability that may flourish at Colorado College, which he committed to."
175,2012,Matt Benning,"Son of ex-pro Brian, he plays with his head on a swivel, and is able to see all of the ice and make smart adjustments. Very tough player with up-ice skill. He is a long term developmental player."
176,2012,Petteri Lindbohm,Strong defensive defenseman with an aggressive style but limited upside.
174,2012,Francis Beauvillier,"Active fleet center who shoots the puck extremely well. At the CHL Prospects game, he bested seven other contestants in one lap around the rink competition with a 14.132 second score. Was asked to participate in the NHL Research & Development Camp in August. Billed as a quick power type wing with jam, he seemed to show little scoring consistency, jam, and failed to play an intense game. Did show up more prominently during his team's playoff run. Possesses tons of the skills that NHL teams look for in forwards. It remains to be seen if he commits to further development."
173,2012,Anton Zlobin,"Second year eligible player who we had projected as a possible 4th rounder last year. Made significant progress as a solid offensive threat. A player with an extra gear who can leave the enemy flat-footed when he breaks up ice, and can score on a breakaway or shoot-out due to his patience and hands. Can be strong on the puck in tight quarters but seems at this point to be happy just getting open and being a perimeter player."
171,2012,Tomáš Hyka,"Attended Flyers preseason training camp, where he had an excellent camp despite his size. His skating and puck possession skills were top-notch. Has quick, soft hands and passes the puck well in transition. However, his size may limit his effectiveness in the tougher pro game."
169,2012,Vincent Hinostroza,Undersized wing with high hockey IQ coupled with excellent puck skills. Needs more involvement down low and a bit more quickness.
167,2012,Riley Barber,"A player who passes the puck well, and understands the attack zone. He has a smooth stride with good balance, and is one of those kids who does so much very well. An incredibly hard worker, who never takes a shift off. He can play with grit, good hands, and has offensive upside."
170,2012,James De Haas,"Big rangy D-man with a nice style that plays to his size. Considered a stay-at-home player at this juncture, but has some up-ice game. Has committed to Clarkson College"
168,2012,Cliff Watson,"Aggressive developmental defenseman who has size, good skating and passing abilities, and players well in his own zone."
165,2012,Coda Gordon,"Solid wing with great strength and some abilities to generate and also score. Reads the ice well, finds the open spots, has good feet and size, and has scoring prowess. Is less a puck carrier than a soft area guy who knows where to be to get the puck back. Scored 30 goals as a WHL rookie in 2011-12, but production stalled as the year was ending. Needs improved first step quickness."
164,2012,Simon Fernholm,"Plays for Huddinge Jr. Raw developmental giant defenseman with a good skills package who plays strong and tough, but needs to refine his feet and awareness. His size allows a body and stick that clogs the lanes."
161,2012,Jake Dotchin,A right-hander who plays both sides and provides a physical presence. Feet and decision-making are in need of an improvement.
188,2012,Louie Nanne,Undersized winger with good shot. Committed to the University of Minnesota.
158,2012,Christophe Bertschy,"At this juncture, he is a well-polished offensive player, playing with older experienced players. Gets to the front. Is deliberate and quick with his decisions and uses his great speed to gain separation. Small and shows little grit, but has desirable offensive upside."
159,2012,Collin Olson,Big goaler who is far from the finished product but has all the tools to continue his development to the higher levels. Plays an excellent positional game and is a cool player when things heat up down low. Functionally strong and holds his position in the paint. Must get quicker.
166,2012,Francois Brassard,"Although lacking the bigger sized package so many of today's goaltender prospects have, Brassard plays big. Fearless at challenging shooters with his quick reflexes and good lateral movement. He needs work at tracking the puck, dealing with traffic and simply developing his body and game."
160,2012,Ryan Olsen,"Intriguing forward who is still not close to the sum of his parts. Has big, quick, and excellent hands. Skates with a strong stride and good balance. He has good vision, but so far has not shown his talents on a consistent basis. Jekyll-Hyde exemplifies his performances and he lacks the intensity at times one would expect gamers to show when the team needs it."
156,2012,Connor Brown,"Mature late riser whose father is coach of the Toronto Marlboros in the GTHL. Heady player who skates and thinks the game well. Extremely hard worker who shows he wants to be a player by his actions as a leader on and off the ice. Despite playing for a thin Erie club, he is the second leading scorer among first year players in the OHL."
155,2012,Jesse Graham,"Undersized offenseman who has tremendous up-ice ability but so far struggles in the defensive aspects of his game. Much of his weaknesses were masked by his pairing with early 2011 pick Dougie Hamilton. His size and strength make battles with attackers difficult. He simply gets out-sized and knocked off the puck, and cannot firmly handle them as they engage him in his zone. On the offensive end, he is a speedster with good vision and creativity who can run a PP. He confidently controls play whenever he has the puck. He is an excellent puck-handler who can score from anywhere and reads and reacts going to the scoring areas. Not a player who is ever intimidated. The question may be, can he get bigger and stronger, and play the position of defense as to not back off from contact or run from it."
150,2012,Alex Kerfoot,Undersized quick-handed point a game scorer in the BCHL.
148,2012,Niklas Tikkinen,"Undersized puck-rushing defender who's a shifty carrier with quick feet and mobility. Can control the play, escape pressure and make the first pass. Good in distribution on the PP, but his shot needs work. Is learning the defensive position, since he was solely a forward until 18 months ago. Is stellar along the wall and in one-on-one's. Long term prospect, but displays excellent vision and sense of play. Still must get bigger and gain strength to handle attackers."
146,2012,Francois Tremblay,"Excellent goaltender with size, quick legs, and tons of potential that has scouts scrutinizing him night in and out. The goaltending factory known at the Quebec Major Junior seems to always provide at least one solid advanced prospect with a quick glove and technically sound game. Keeps his team in games when the teams' defense fails. A battler who is exceptional in the trapezoid, and is good with his stick in more ways than that. Squares up well and tracks the puck well. A rising prospect."
157,2012,Ryan Rupert,"The London Knight's twins both have a good chance to be selected, but Ryan's overall toughness, hands, skating, and lead-by-example style, bumps him up higher. He has been asked to take regular shifts at right wing with the London team's plethora of centers."
145,2012,Cody Payne,"Prototypical big center prospect with a heavy shot. Bruiser who commands respect and makes room for his teammates. Good wall warrior and very responsible defensively. Decent hands but his offensive game is a work in progress. Hasn't shown feel for the attack zone yet, except for when he moves to the front, where he poses problems. Hard worker whose skating acceleration and agility need improvement as well as his offensive vision and implementation."
142,2012,Thomas Spelling,Top-rated Danish prospect who is tall and lean and still playing for his hometown team. He has good overall skills and a willingness to improve. Long term developmental pick who will need to come across the pond to play the North American style.
141,2012,Reece Willcox,"Big two-way defenseman who plays a smart game, is a good up-ice puck distributor with good vision. Joins the rush and is an exceptional passer on the offense. Has a quick stick and holds good body position on attacking forwards.  Will need to add some snarl to his repertoire.  He has committed to Cornell University."
138,2012,Daniel O'Regan,"Solid under six footer who is good in all phases. He had a solid performance in the tournament 2011 U.S. Under-18 Select Team in Slovakia. Committed to Boston University, as he is the son of former Terrier and NHL forward Tom O'Regan. Two-way center with grit, gears, and excellent transitional instincts. Plays on the PK and is a threat to move the puck for a scoring play every shift."
140,2012,Michael McKee,"Until two and half seasons ago, was playing forward. The switch happened at a good time because he was just growing and developing his feet and agility. He already had a pretty good skill-set for a big guy, good hands and a good shot. He needs to put much more development in learning the defensive position, and although NHL teams may be projecting him as an energy forward type, it might be in his interest to concentrate on learning to be a defender, as his long term value would increase."
149,2012,Travis Brown,Developing defensive prospect with size and agility.
135,2012,Graham Black,"Excellent defensive forward who is a very good penalty-killer, back-checker and overall checker. He has excellent stop/start speed, grittiness, with improving offensive ability."
137,2012,Connor Carrick,Mobile defender with good quickness and skill set. He moves well laterally and is a willing shot-blocker. Good transition up-ice player with good hands and a decent shot. Excellent long-term prospect at defense.
136,2012,Robbie Baillargeon,"Strong offensive sniper that needs to get bigger and play bigger in the battle areas of the attack zone. Plays strong on the puck. Has a deceptively heavy snap shot and has improved his creativity as an offensive generator. At this juncture, we are unsure if he projects as a center or RW."
133,2012,Logan Nelson,"Tall, thin right-handed center who by Christmas was on a point/game pace in the DUB. He plays physical and has some offensive talent."
131,2012,Seth Griffith,"Skinny offensive play-making forward who is working on getting bigger and more confident. Both play-maker and sniper, but also is an excellent penalty killer. He has the head to be a really nice scorer when NHL strong. His skating is a work in progress but there is no denying the fact that he leads his club (one of the better junior teams) in many areas and plays with some grit. He easily rotates from the side board to the point on the power play, and is an excellent passer and set-up man. 2nd year eligible leads his team in scoring and it is very difficult to dismiss his chances to be successful at the higher levels."
132,2012,Michael Clarke,"Good two-way disciplined player who is already an excellent face-off man and is a surprisingly good player for a rookie. Already playing in key situations and handling the pressure. He is a guy who will stand in front and work through the trash, putting in rebounds. Plays in all situations and can play on any line. Good PP & PK guy, and a willing shot-blocker."
129,2012,Brendan Woods,"3rd year eligible player, son of Bob Woods former Hershey Bears head coach, went undrafted due to a broken left femur. His rehab was lengthy. Attended Capitals pre-season camp, where his father serves as an assistant coach. He continues to improve foot speed and leg strength. He shoots the puck well, and finds the open spaces to set up. Works the wall and dirty areas. Once moving, he is a load. Short space quickness is the area in need of improvement. Good sized package with considerable upside long term."
126,2012,Dominic Toninato,"Skilled player who had the luxury of playing with two talented players on a dominant line at Duluth East. He is an electric player and an intriguing prospect, but it will take time for his game to round out."
128,2012,Daniel Gunnarsson,"Rising physical two-way defender, who skates with balance and hits with power. Skilled puck-handler who can pass the puck accurately or take it end to end. Has a strong physical presence along the wall and in front as well as the ability to control gaps with a quick stick or a quick burst into the area."
127,2012,Brian Cooper,"Three year vet of the USHL who excels as an offensive generator and PP point man. Alaskan native, carries the mail and despite his small stature plays with an edge. Plays tough and smart with or without the puck. Needs to gain more overall strength to contend with the larger bodies he engages."
58,2011,Nikita Kucherov,Highly skilled undersized wing with good gears and a nose for the net who is learning to play entire games without taking time off.
134,2012,Branden Troock,"Potential power winger has good enough feet to be effective in transition and in getting to the openings on offense. He could stand to gain leg strength and get quicker in his first two steps, but once he gets up stream he is hard to stop and drives to scoring areas. He was second in the CHL prospects game skills competition for fastest skater. He needs to improve his playmaking and scoring abilities, but is no stranger to the battle areas or being a physical force along the wall. He is learning to stand up for himself and teammates, and is getting noticed by scouts as a good developmental selection."
56,2011,Lucas Lessio,"Enigmatic speedy winger who teases with spurts of advanced abilities. Although not a polished scorer, backchecker, or energy player, he does at times show intensity and drive that seems missing if you watch him for a couple games in a row. Likes attacking and plays interested, even gritty down low, but turns it on/off. Can the switch stay on?"
125,2012,Doyle Somerby,"Raw big framed defender who has room to get bigger. Long-term project who could be a find, with work on his footwork."
54,2011,Scott Harrington,"One of the top stay-at-home defenders in the draft. There is upside, but teams will be delighted with the toolbox that he already possesses. He is content being a reliable player who sticks to the phases he knows he can achieve with above average results and makes his team (and defensive partner) better. A big hitter, with really good skating ability, balance and agility. Has a nice shot. Even in the attack sticks to what he knows are within his ability level, and does not try to play beyond his present level. He has upside and is a truly good hockey player with potential."
124,2012,Ryan Culkin,"Hard working on an off the ice. An exceptional skater who is gaining strength, endurance, and experience. Has two-way ability and plays big minutes."
55,2011,Ryan Sproul,"Has size and skating ability. Can play both sides on defense. Lines up off-hand on many power plays. Has a powerful low shot from outside and easily jumps in on the rush. Another rising prospect, who with time can be a weapon at the major league level."
52,2011,Miikka Salomaki,"An effective supplementary defensive player who reads the entire ice and situation very well, but is a short strider with little speed and limited offensive abilities as his hands and stick have not caught up with the high tempo game speed. Is a determined penalty-kill guy, and really good forechecker, who is always willing to go to the wall to take punishment and unearth pucks. He is smart with the puck in transition when the turnover happens, but gets handcuffed when he is involved in a high speed penetration that might require a snap decision and follow through."
50,2011,Johan Sundstrom,"A promising net crasher who keeps his time with the puck short and simple. Has a strong stride and is a physical presence that flies in to the jams and disrupts, using his stick almost as well as his body."
51,2011,Alexander Ruuttu,"Bloodlines may aid the Chicago-born Ruuttu, son of former NHL player Christian. He is still a work in progress, and his feet have to catch up to his growth spurt. He nonetheless is improving his face-offs, checking, and feet."
57,2011,Tyler Wotherspoon,"Playing with a strong Winterhawks team that needs little help up-ice, he concentrates on being tough and active in the smaller area, where at present he doesn't get into any trouble. He has little foot speed and average agility at the junior level. Long term project."
48,2011,Xavier Ouellet,"A player who plays consistently average but has room for growth and improvement. Is a gifter point shooter, but needs plenty of work on his back end."
47,2011,Matthew Nieto,Rocket skater who can beat defenders from the outside. Quality penalty killer and uses his speed to cover in his own end. Shows offensive smarts and good hands but needs more functional strength.
53,2011,William Karlsson,"Strong skating energy player who plays hard all over the rink. Has a good jump, but is a basically a North-South guy who can crash the zone and the front. Will rely on his teammates to do the creative and banging work to set up scoring chances, but at 18, he has time to develop his skills."
49,2011,Christopher Gibson,"Top QMJHL goaler has a Brit and a Finn for parents. Players well, but needs improvement on his glove and feet."
45,2011,Markus Granlund,"Like his brother who was drafted in the first round last year, he displays a strong offensive game with a strong superb touch in the passing game and a quick wrister. Excellent puck handler, but stays out of battle zones and takes many perimeter shots. Never going to be guy who goes in and battles for the biscuit but he most certainly will fill other needs in an offensive-starved team."
42,2011,Victor Rask,"Big three zone centermen who will go in to do the dirty work to unearth pucks in the battle zones, and be able to hold the puck and wait for openings. Moves really well and is a excellent puck-handler, and offense generator. When he becomes a player who consistently plays well at top speed, he could become a really good major leaguer."
46,2011,Joel Edmundson,"Big western league defender from Brandon, Manitoba who showed that in his first full year,  he would fight anybody and everybody. Must develop his game in all phases but has some upside."
44,2011,Brett Ritchie,"Good balanced straight-ahead wing who passes the puck well and is good carrying it. Had a bit of an injured season, but has shown soft hands for a bigger guy, and exceptional wall work. If he was able to get quicker, he would be an even bigger force to contend with when he goes to the net/slot area."
43,2011,Brandon Saad,"Strong big winger with good hands and vision, who creates space, and has some nasty in his game. He is a competitor who is difficult to handle in front and near the net and displays a quick snapper of a shot in a toolbox that looks to be pro-bound big time. Like so many gifted two way players, he tends to overlook a strong commitment to his defensive zone at times. It remains to be seen if he can embrace this type of role as competition gets tougher."
41,2011,Dmitri Jaskin,"Large, physical power wing type with a nice hard wrist shot, good vision and decent hands.  Big and strong on the puck in battle areas, but his skating needs to improve. He is deceptively quick North-South on the blades though. Was out seven weeks with a knee injury. Has many desirable parts but needs improvement to become the sum of those parts."
39,2011,John Gibson,"Top goaltender in this draft, who has good size, advancing technique, and upside. Covers lots of the net because of his size and playing square to the attacker. The reason he isn't rated as high as a first rounder is because he has tended to become a guesser and shows a lack of consistency due to his losing track of the puck and poor sizing up of the ensuing play. That doesn't mean he isn't a promising prospect though, because he does display a very large, mature and calm presence in the net."
40,2011,Alexander Khokhlachev,"Undersized offensive player with great instincts in the offensive zone. Has a full set of gears and real speed. Is a team guy, and although he is primarily an offensive player, he is working on his decision-making to complete his game."
38,2011,Magnus Hellberg,"Large, calm presence who shows good flexibility and has excellent technique. He squares up, covers the bottom and his shoulders cover the top. Quick feet and a really good long term project."
36,2011,Adam Clendening,Solid offensive point man who moves great laterally along the attacking blue line and smartly sets up the attack with his low snapper. Understands the attack zone and uses his passing and stickhandling to set the plays up.
33,2011,Rocco Grimaldi,"I have my prejudices and never EVER thought I would even consider a guy his size as a first rounder, but there is no way he doesn't belong in consideration based on his on-ice performances. Simply the best all around skilled guy in the draft. Fearless, tough, a lightning shot, and super quick hands and feet. He is too fierce a competitor to think his size will stop him. It is what it is. The question remains: which NHL team has the cahones to take him here?"
30,2011,Rickard Rakell,"Opportunistic jam player with great stick skills. Hard to play against as a three zone hitter, who riles the opposition by playing his game. Unfinished project at this point, but showing all the qualities to turn into an NHL'er, since he makes his own opportunities with turnovers and an improving offensive game. Moved from wing to center this last year and is a Swedish import who thrives on being an effective three zone player who will knock you down to get the puck."
35,2011,Tomas Jurco,"Player whose hand-eye coordination and stick-work is off the charts. Fearless wall player who at this point looks like more of a set-up man than scorer. Granted, he has a quick release, but he seems more willing to make an unselfishness play as a set-up man. He works the corners and front very well to the benefit of his linemates. Needs work on the defensive side of his game, more strength and girth."
29,2011,Nicklas Jensen,He has great size and speed/skill ratio. Shows a lot of desirable qualities you look for in a prospect.  Needs better conditioning but shows a nice quick touch in close.
34,2011,Scott Mayfield,"A long term project that many teams are interested in due to his great size, puck skills, skating, and shades of snarl.  Already has shown some good carrying skills, and an accurate first pass. He is also capable of springing teammates on the long pass to the opposing blue line. Although far from ready to play against faster players, he is an agile big man that will get consideration early."
28,2011,Zack Phillips,"Forwards in the Q can sometime be a challenge to project. Not necessarily whether or not they will become pros, but whether their efforts in junior can translate as they climb the steps. (Here is where I could start to mention Jakub Voracek and others.) No one can deny what Phillips can do: he is a finisher, but not overly fast or big."
32,2011,Ty Rattie,"Scorer with an accurate shot that he needs little room to launch. Opportunistic shooter, who isn't a burner but uses the gears he does have offensively and in his defensive commitments. Needs to get stronger."
27,2011,Vladislav Namestnikov,"A good hands centerman who plays with jump and enthusiasm. A lot like the kid in Atlanta, Alexander Burmisitrov, but much farther away from contributing at the NHL level."
25,2011,Stuart Percy,"Undersized defender who has limited offensive potential, but none the less is a solid all-around defenseman. Diagnoses trouble in his end and more than adequately is able to get his team out of it."
37,2011,Boone Jenner,"Big center who plays fearlessly with good balance and puck position. A team leader who may get even bigger, and already plays all three zones. Skating is a work in progress, as is his passing. He likes to carry and shoot, as well as be physical. His defensive game needs work along with his foot speed. He does everything above average, but so far is not special in any specific area. He plays a gritty game though and comes ready to play. The question may come down to if he can continue to elevate his offensive side."
24,2011,Matt Puempel,"Top skill wing of the draft, whose acceleration, lateral quickness, touch and shot put him in line to be drafted early as he begins to put his game to work on a consistent basis. Well built, but still needs to get stronger. Pretty much a natural in the offensive zone because he has a nice feel for play there. He has a tremendous heavy shot, and a player who is good in tight spaces. He still needs to commit and be schooled in the nuances of the defensive zone, and gain the desire to battle for lost pucks in the offensive zone."
23,2011,Joe Morrow,"A player whose status elevated based on a strong showing this last season. His emerging puck carrying abilities, power play work, and all around toughness have moved him up the lists. Still needs to get more strength and better awareness in the defensive zone, and is a long term developmental guy who may have upside. So far as a point shot and rusher, the best may be yet to come."
22,2011,Tyler Biggs,"Big three zone, mean wing who will probably have to continue to upgrade his quickness to be a force at the next level. He is a tough, on-ice leader/protector and will lay heavy checks within the rules in almost every game he plays. He has nice balance, a wide skating base and a solid quick stride. Yet Biggs is basically a North-South guy who has an accurate shot, soft hands, and a pro-style build. Thus his goals will come in the crease area where he will cause major disruptions when he anchors down in front and on passes he unearthed along the wall. His father (Don) was a longtime minor pro player. There really is little to not like about him if he is given a slower track to continue his improvement."
26,2011,Phillip Danault,"Speedy center-forward who reads and understands the attack zone well, and separates himself. Plays on both the PK and PP. High motored player, whose difficult to project to the pro game because he has little room to grow on his slight frame. Once settled in at a position and growing a bit more muscle mass, we will have an answer as to where he may fit as a pro."
19,2011,Oscar Klefbom,"Rising offenseman who, so far, has shown little snarl in his own zone, but is a constant threat in the attack zone. Needs to get (and play) bigger and better in his own end. A balanced strong strider, and a good carrier with a bit of jump. Like many young D-men, there needs to be improvement on his play in his end, but there is no denying that he is a fearless attack player with great size."
20,2011,Connor Murphy,"Another in a long line of U.S. grown big defensemen who year after draft year look to have so many interesting characteristics, although on their draft day the players are not finished products. Big framed, good skater and puck carrier. Has good puck skills but still learning the nuances of attacking. Injury put him out of viewing for the Under 17s, but the very fact that his father is a former NHL'er puts him on the radar of all 30 NHL clubs in the last half of the first round. Already displays an active stick and decent gap control due to his strong skating game. Raw long term project with possible big payoff. If he doesn't go last first round, I doubt he gets past the Columbus pick at slot 37."
31,2011,David Musil,"Burgeoning prospect whose hockey resume is filled with high Hockey IQ marks. Has all the tools and qualities you look for in a big defenseman. Besides being able to separate attackers from the biscuit, he has above average skating steps and hands that may someday establish him as a fine two-way defenseman. Right now his biggest attribute is that he is an excellent box-out defender whose small area quickness in hands and feet can contain and strip attackers. Although he has the above-average balance and strength, he has little up-ice foot speed when he starts out, and that might very well hurt where he gets picked. Once going, he can carry the mail, and is a good outlet passer. Upside is always part of projecting defenseman and it surely doesn't hurt that his father was an NHL vet. The finished product may be a superior talent. He shows that he can effectively continue to use his body and skate to neutralize attackers, and only time will tell us if this kid can become an offensive force also."
17,2011,Nathan Beaulieu,"It would be easy to look at him and say his most impressive trait is his work on the strong St. John power play, but there is lots to like about him all over the ice. He is a good stretch passer, and handles carrying well too. The strength of his game is his skating. He has a wide base, good balance and a nice stride and acceleration. This gives him an advantage in defensive coverage, and can carry the mail at full speed. Good wrist shot and fine bloodlines."
15,2011,J.T. Miller,"A center-wing who plays a nice puck possession game with grit and bodywork. Some say he may not apply himself consistently to this style and his draft stock will drop if he doesn't become committed 60 minutes. Yet I don't think it is a question of intent as much as he has emptied the tank with his earlier efforts. Punishes on the attack and skates with good balance and jump. He is a good shooter and decent passer and good in his own zone. He is very creative on his carries, and is solid in all zones. Once in transit he can move with the best of them. Although he lacks a first step and doesn't consistently play strong on the puck when in the attack, he will be given time to add to his offensive game, since the payout may be a big reward to the team that selects him.  Exceeds tags labeling him a checking line role player."
21,2011,Stefan Noesen,"Part two of the Whalers top line is a physical player who works at taking pucks away from the winger position with good jam. A very good penalty-killer, he has shown offensive upside at right wing which he displayed in his home state of Texas. A certain pick in the first two rounds for this hard working prospect."
18,2011,Mark McNeill,"Strong skating center who is growing into a role as an aggressive big center. Not a ballerina-type but a North-South skater with nice balance, agility, speed, and skating stride. He is an unpolished young center, still learning to skate the puck. He has good hands, passes the puck very well, and is growing in his improvement and aggressive play. He is a rising prospect who may be long gone before this pick."
12,2011,Ryan Murphy,"Undersized defenseman anomaly who may not be all that versed in his defensive zone but seems a head above almost all other North American defensemen in the offensive and transition game. This puck mover can get up the ice super-quick, keep control of the puck and play, and handle the pressure of being the carrier better than all others. He is a thing of beauty, the way he shoots up ice like a cannonball and can go through an opponent's entire team playing keep away. Calm and poised, he simply doesn't give it up, and quickly can thread the needle of a seam to his team's advantage. He can make any junior player look bad due to his foot speed and hands. He is the Power Play general with an accurate shot, but he does need to add more bulk and size to his thin body. Personally, I love these ""Ryan Ellis"" type picks, because you can use the success/failure rate of these type of defensive players and balance it against each NHL team's new emphasis to find many rear guards. Since teams see quick transition as their number one priority, they can avoid effortlessly going up the ice. Teams just can't resist game-breakers, and if a comfortable defensive partner can balance an offensivemen's liability, the rewards offensively out-weighs the risks. Tremendous wheels, great vision, and great puck distribution."
16,2011,Joel Armia,"Soft handed, big Finn sniper with a high compete ability, skill level, and improving skating prowess. Receives and handles the puck well, good forechecker, and cornerman. He has good vision, a quick shot, and a quick stick. Not a burner but deceptively fast once he gets going. Fearless in the battle areas and able to play with or without the puck at a high speed. He has displayed good effort on the back-check, and a quick release in the attack zone."
14,2011,Jamie Oleksiak,"This is a player that you definitely draft and hope he develops. He needs plenty of work on lateral pivots and all around footwork, but the guy does have good balance and a nice stride up ice. His hands are not stone. His size gives him plenty of advantage in small passing lanes and on the poke check. You'd like more jam to go with his size. A project that many teams will think about around the middle-late first round."
9,2011,Dougie Hamilton,"Rising prospect whose physical package and fluid skating ability has put him on the map as a NHL future defender. He is already being compared in ability to many of the early defense picks of past drafts, but at this point, he cannot be seen as their equals. However, his natural athletic abilities and upside are what have so many teams talking about him. He is safely a top-two pair guy, with no ceiling in terms of the defensive position. He could become the guy on defense. His parents are former Olympic athletes. He is a high character kid, and scholastic player of the year. He may just grow into a star of an NHL defense with continued growth and commitment. He was not viewed as an up ice guy when the season started, but as a solid defender, who compares favorably in that aspect with any past drafted defenders. He showed a radical jump in his offensive game, and although he shows a mean streak when you come down in his defensive area, he also is a bit timid when the favor is returned. All this might have jacked him ahead or equal to Adam Larsson at this point. Excellent gap closer who can gain the space that disrupts an opponent's attack and is completely solid in the defensive zone. Can use his size to deliver big hits, and makes that solid first pass. No slouch when letting it rip from the point, where he cannons the biscuit. Far from a poised finished prospect, this lanky drink of water doesn't look out of place against higher competition. He has shown offensive and defensive attributes that cannot be ignored by the NHL staffs. He very well could easily be the top defenseman selected this year, and will definitely be the second if he isn't the first."
11,2011,Duncan Siemens,"Tough, stay-at-home defender with some offensive upside. His skating is a work in progress. Stick skills need work. Great at the junior level of controlling the gaps. Siemens understands he has to be nasty defender and improve all other facets, and he is dedicated in doing so. It is just a matter of when his name gets called based on what the present package is."
6,2011,Mika Zibanejad,"High-motor, power center with size and soft hands. His two-way play, vision, crease presence, and corner work, along with good size and tools, make switching him to wing (where he has also played) an easy transition. He has some touch to his passing ability, but also has a heavy snapshot. He has good top gear, but his turns and skating need refinement as there is a hitch in his strides. A strong determined forechecker who finishes his checks. This kid looks like a willing-to-improve fireball who will make strides after a while in the bigs."
8,2011,Sean Couturier,"May have become Angelo Esposito-like in his fall from grace of once being thought of as the top pick. Big, strong game-breaking scorer-generator, who has a terrific Hockey IQ and feel for the game situations, seemingly projecting him as a can't-miss NHL center. A terrific stick handler, tape to tape passer and playmaker with a long reach and quick stick. Can hold the puck an extra bit to free space for teammates, and while the puck is on a teammates stick, he seems to know where to position himself to cause the most damage. With great stick skills comes an improving heavy accurate shot. Very responsible and active in his own zone. Not the fastest guy, his skating might be his only area that will require improvement. It might be that when he puts all the pieces together, he becomes a strong NHL player with the goal of becoming a first line centre. Some say his upside is limited to second line center since he hasn't seemed to grow further this season, but no NHL team sees him as a consolation prize."
10,2011,Jonas Brodin,"Calm all-around rearguard whose offensive game will improve. Cannot afford to throw his weight, because he needs to get so much bigger. He understands positioning and reaction in his own defensive zone, and already makes a good first pass, has good all around hockey sense, and potential to grow his up-ice puck carrying game. He moves up and into the play, and can put it on the tape if he's given the puck when he has jumped in. Turns very, very well and has excellent movement laterally and in pivots. He has an active stick and so far in international play displays excellent gap control. Another one of the rising Scadi prospects. In the past, has been a pointman on the PP."
5,2011,Ryan Strome,"Another player who simply catapulted himself with a radical spike in his play. What happened from last year to this? He simply got stronger, bigger, and more driven. He has a tremendous skill level, and may be the best stickhandler in the draft. With a one timer that is deadly, you don't have to go far to find videos of his highlight reel goals and persistent attacks. Developmental trajectory went through the roof, much to the delight of the teams picking in the top ten looking for offense."
7,2011,Mark Scheifele,"Good sized play-making forward who Coach Dale Hawerchuck has taken under his wing. He is working to build muscle mass, and is working to get faster, less heavy-footed and skate with a lower center of gravity. Plays strong on the puck and once going is effortless in his playmaking. Long term project, who may have elevated himself into the first round by virtue of a superb performance at the Under-18 Worlds."
3,2011,Jonathan Huberdeau,"Plays on a veteran club and, on many a night, is the best player on that club and even carrying it. Skinny, smooth skater who has soft hands, good vision, and good touch. He has good speed once he is moving but doesn't seem to have high end starting gear. He is good in the attack whether he has the puck or not. He reads the ice and passes the puck well. He is always in there after loose pucks. Has seen more action at wing then center, which in my opinion, he is better suited to play. That should not be a deterrent, as it just makes him more versatile. He needs more commitment to the defensive side, but has a knack in the defensive zone to get things ironed out and gets back going the other way on offense."
4,2011,Adam Larsson,"Very safe, early pick. Big skilled defender with calm demeanor, upsize ability, and a bit of snarl. Teams drafting early will see him as a complete package defender who almost certainly fills one of their top four for many years. With the big three forwards all showing tiny parts of themselves that might cause early selectors to shy away from them, this kid has little anyone can have misgivings about. If a team feels defense is where they need upgrading, they may call his name very early. It remains to be seen if his decision to return in 2011-12 to Sweden to play for Skellefteå in the Elitserien will impact his selection since a team picking high may want him making his adjustment to North American smaller rinks starting sooner instead of later."
1,2011,Ryan Nugent-Hopkins,"After tiny Rocco Grimaldi, he is the best skilled guy in the draft. Some guys just have it. One of the good hands people, he shows a gifted ability to work with his skate and stick in traffic, and with excellent acceleration. He seems instinctive and opportunistic offensively. A soft passer and natural scorer, has an accurate shot and doesn't hesitate due to great coordination and desire.  Suberb smart Hockey IQ kid who passes the puck like a musical conductor. He might be prone to sometimes retreating and playing a perimeter game, but that certainly seems to disappear when the hips are down. Obviously far too small and needs bulk and strength, but showed continued willingness in the CHL prospects game, showing he is far from timid and willing at his present level. He simply has the best offensive upside down the road."
13,2011,Sven Bartschi,"Undersized opportunistic scorer with great stick skills and good wheels, who he needs little room to launch (or he is prone to being a perimeter player?).  He moves well East-West, and will need to improve his involvement in puck battles. Easily one on the quicker first step wingers available. Needs time."
211,2013,Robin Press,"Tall lanky Swedish defenseman who didn't play defense solely until Christmas 2011, making him a long term project with a possible big reward. Excellent outlet passer and already has the stretch pass down. Is very comfortable with the puck on his stick and not bothered by heavy hitting. He must build an aggressive physical game of his own, but that will be part of the long term development."
210,2013,Mitchell Dempsey,"Big-bodied wing that eventually projects as a rugged power forward. Once going,he can show some speed, and has some scoing ability."
2,2011,Gabriel Landeskog,"Excellent wall player, with a great attitude that only increases the enthusiastic play of his teammates. The Swedish import is starting to fill out and has displayed the tools necessary to climb the ladder to the pros, as he already captains his Kitchener OHA team. Will hit, pass, score, and fight. Will bring feistiness, and a power wing package to the NHL, with the biggest question being if he can become an NHL money scorer. No holes in his defensive game either as he'll get back and get involved with blocks, hits and puck battles."
205,2013,Miles Liberati,"Played on a stacked roster in London, he saw much less time than most other prospects, but will have a bigger role next season. He is very mobile quick and a good passer and offensive generatot from the back end. He just need reps to improve his game and play in more pressurred situations to gain experience. His long term future looks to be on an upswing."
201,2013,Jacob Jackson,A high school centre who displays good all-around abilities and creativity. Is developing a strong two-way game and is tough. Projects as a versatile forward who can slide anywhere on a teams bottom six...if he continues to get strong and improve his game.
209,2013,Troy Josephs,"Solid wing prospect who has excelled in the OJHL, but as of yet to see tougher opposition. Really understands the attack zone and has a good feel, much like Patrick Sharp, where, he plays off the defenders, as opposed to taking all of them on. His quickness makes him very effective near the goal line and wins and hold pucks. good on the wall and makes great use of the boards to advance the play. By no stretch timid but will need to get stronger as the competition in college hockey ramps up. Long term possible with nice skill/compete package."
204,2013,Tyler Lewington,"Has steadily improved as a decent stay at home defender with a reliable defensive game, who is able to win pucks and clear the crease. skates exceptional well. Has engaged in many a fight in his WHL."
200,2013,Alexandre Bélanger,"Agile netminder who made his debut this year in the QMJHL, as a workhorse for the Huskies.  Displays decent rebound control, athleticism and quickness."
206,2013,MacKenzie Weegar,"Second year eligible smaller defender who possesses strong offensive ability and an excellent point shot, and keen hockey sense. Good skater who will jump in or lead the rush. Strong passing skills, and PP QB. Was part of a Halifax Moosehead team that won the Memorial Cup. Needs work on his strength and physicality in his own end."
196,2013,Kyle Burroughs,"Quietly developing into a power play QB and leader. Has an above average sense of where to pass the puck and has added a new threat for the Pats from the back end. Will need work to get stronger and improve his defense, but there is a lot to like in this long term defense project."
197,2013,Nolan De Jong,"Has good size and some offensive game. Uses his size and reach to his advantage. Needs a bit more aggression and must become more instinctive with his positioning, but is a smooth skating carrier. More strength is a must."
202,2013,Andreas Johnson,"Smaller swedish forward who can play all three forward positions and provide offensive.  Is gowing and getting stonger. Fearless in high-traffic areas and battle zones, he is at this point a long term prospect."
199,2013,Hampus Melen,Pkays for Tingsryd Swedish Jr.
191,2013,Dominik Kubalik,"Czech import who is in his first season in North America. He is a skilled winger who is willing to work the wall and dirty areas to win puck battles.Possesses a strong hard shot which he lets go very quickly.  In Czech Republic, he played in the men's pro league at 16. Possesses a hard shot and a willingness to crash the front., and has playmaking skills. Skates with strong stride and has good balance and a quick burst. Handles the puck well but is not a free style creator, but more of a guy who can get open and score if you get it to him. Needs more girth and continued development in the defensive zone. His older brother Tomas, was a Columbus pick. He was selected to the roster for the World Junior Under-18 Tournament in April."
189,2013,Eric Locke,"Offensive wing who stands equal to any stickhandler in this draft class. Was called upon to be the main man on a club in need of more offensive threats. He plays on the power play, and is not a player who neglects his responsibilities in his own zone. He has continued to add leg strength and all-around muscle. After being traded, he had both knee and concussion injuries, but still finished with 40 points. This season, he had over 60 points before February. His size may work against him, but his not afraid of bigger competitors and will stand up for himself against them with his fists."
195,2013,Peter Quenneville,"Second year eligible was voted the League MVP and winner of the Alberta Old Time Hockey Players Trophy for the 2011-2012 AJHL season, as he led the Crusaders in scoring with 81 points in the regular season, good enough for 3rd overall in the AJHL Scoring Race. keen offensive abilities and awareness. and inproving defensive game. He has committed to Quinnipiac University. He is the second cousin of the coach the Chicago Blackhawks."
123,2012,Joey Laleggia,"Undersized Freshman defender who plays a solid two-way game at the collegiate level. Named the Hockey Commissioners Association national rookie of the year, and he WCHA’s rookie of the year based on his 11 goal, 38 point performance."
122,2012,Charles Simard-Hudon,"After exhibiting outstanding instincts and opportunistic strikes in the Ivan Hlinka Tourney, there is reason to believe that this water bug can eventually build himself into a NHLer. He displays tremendous skill, vision and understanding of the game, and is an elite scorer and playmaker. He has nice touch, very quick soft hands and elusive speed to set up in the attack at a moment's notice. A superb finisher who just appears at right time to receive the scoring pass or a tip-in. Takes hits, appears out of nowhere to score. Boom or bust prospect due to the fact he is never going to be a strong defensive stalwart…or a larger man."
121,2012,Nikolay Prokhorkin,Defensively responsible center with long reach and good puck skills. Strong on the puck and a good first step with a nice stride.
119,2012,Calle Andersson,"Rising Swedish rearguard with great skating abilities, physically, and offensive upside. His fluidity, lateral speed, and pivoting ability allow him to control gaps, close lanes defensively. His smooth puck handling skills make him a transition horse as he reads the ice well and plays with patience. Power play general with a nice shot and stick skills to take advantage of any slide-downs to the slot. He reads the ice well in all zones and looks to be another good prospect for a team looking for a defender."
188,2013,Gregory Chase,"Doesn't wow you with elite abilities, but gets your attention immediately. This strong skating DUB centre who has excellent stick skills, good feet and is a really tough competitor. He has a wide skating stance, good balance, and understands tempo and sees the ice very well. He displays quick hands, and is the first player into the attack zone to take the puck back. Unselfish with the bisquit and is relentless in pursuit and attack. All eyes will be watching his further development during 2012-13."
187,2013,Rushan Rafikov,"Aggressive Russian defender who is tall and slender and more of a stay-home defenseman. Shows good lateral mobility and gets the puck up ice with good passes. Although he is still developing physically, he plays extremely tough and edgy. Never going to be an offensive upside handler, but already seems to play well within the limits of his capabilities. He was selected to the roster for the World Junior Under-18 Tournament in April."
118,2012,Mikko Vainonen,Long term project who makes solid decisions and reads. Displays good vision and hands. Excellent outlet passer and a very good stretch passer.  Decent in his puck decisions. His skating is his bane; heavy feet and a stiff skating motion retard his ability to stop players wide and those with quick lateral moves. He is still able to start offensive plays with board battles. He may be an intriguing prospect once he plays tougher and skates better.
114,2012,Alexander Delnov,"Russian left-handed right wing with a strong stride and mulitple set of gears. Excellent hands and a strong 200-foot game. Solid skater with functional strength, good puck-handling ability, and a good sense to get open or recognize whom is. Works in all three zones and has surprising lateral ability and a quick release."
115,2012,Trevor Carrick,"Wide-framed skinny kid who is working at adding thickness. A defense-first defender with good feet, and good backward skating ability. He is very good down low in his zone, where he uses both his quick stick and physicality to thwart off attackers. Smart mobile defender who can thread the needle on the outlet pass and close down on attackers. Projects as a player with good upside due to the fact that his decision-making will improve as he reads the ice better. His offensive game will come along."
116,2012,Nick Walters,"Smart defender whose good feet allow him to play solid in his own zone, with good gap control and aggression. He is a good skater, strong with the puck, and has upside as an offensive contributor. He is an opponent who is difficult to play against as he plays hard and nasty. Isn't really an upside offensive type."
110,2012,Andreas Athanasiou,"Has top-end hand-eye coordination to compliment his elusive speed and mobility. Has several gears and uses them in all three zones to attack and take pucks away. He is getting bigger, which will help his draft status since he isn't afraid of battle areas, contact, or moving through traffic. His top speed lets him break away to the outside, and come back to the front of the net. He created more notice after a nice showing in August at both the Ivan Hlinka tourney and the NHL RDO camp. His scoring skills must continue to grow. He is a rounded three-zone responsible guy and smart set up man. He does need to get a heavier gun, as his shot needs work. In a year with forwards taking a back step to defenseman, he may prove a worthy selection at forward. His current pace of production has seen him lag behind in the assist and scoring columns, and that may suggest there is less offensive upside than thought. The pro game now is dependent upon a strong forecheck which he is very capable of providing. He needs to have better puck handling. He takes the puck into dirty areas though to attempt to score, not just settling as a perimeter shooter."
109,2012,Christophe Lalancette,"Smaller wing with exceptional skill, natural toughness, and offensive prowess. Far from the finished product, he nonetheless possesses attributes that project him as a possible future pro."
112,2012,Zach Stepan,"His brother is a New York Ranger, and that helps explain his team-oriented tone, where he leads by example. He plays strong on his skates and simply tries to outwork the opposition with his puck pursuit and work. He has good balance, nice long strides, and shoots a heavy puck. More of a North-South skater but shows a nice upside as he progresses, although he doesn't project as a top six offensive performer. He is more of a battler and guy you want in the circle to take key face-offs and play against the opposition's top lines at the end of games to preserve the lead."
104,2012,Gemel Smith,Smaller relentless bulldog whose rough-and-ready style is contagious. Relentless speed checker who causes turnovers with his forecheck. Has good vision and passing skills. His shot is average but enjoys being the set-up man.
100,2012,Thomas Di Pauli,"Quicker undersized player with a low center of gravity who has good hands and a good head, that allow him to quickly advance the play. Takes face-offs, as he is strong on draws. Plays like a much bigger man, with fearless abandon. Good on the penalty-kill."
105,2012,Brett Kulak,"Alberta native whose game so far is to be a solid, stay-at-home defender, although he does have offensive upside. A good crease-clearer, who reads and reacts well, keeping his team solid in their own end. Long-term project who needs to get stronger and develop as an all-around D-man."
99,2012,Erik Karlsson,"Thin bodied center/wing who has excellent acceleration and speed. This spindle-legged Swede is a deadly shooter with a quick release and nose for the net. Maybe it is the need to bulk up and get stronger, but he seems to run out of gas and that commitment can result in goals late. Early on he flew to the corner to unearth a rebound, but later he was nowhere to be found. He'd shoot and then go to the front for his own rebound and later shy away from the front. He will continue to get bigger, stronger and hopefully become a sixty minute player."
101,2012,Cedric Paquette,"Emerging Quebec league player who displays skills to become a profilic scorer. A big man who is unafraid to engage and use his size, Displays a terrific back hand and strong release on the forehand. He is still developing at the center position, and needs work if he plans to stay there. Is more of a shooter than a passer. Was second on his team in playoff scoring with 7 goals and 17 points and a +6 rating."
97,2012,Kevin Roy,"After being a 13-year old internet sensation with his display in skills competition, and not being drafted lat year, Roy set a USHL modern day record of 54 goals and 104 points in 59 games for the Lincoln Stars. He's got high skills in a smaller package. He will develop his size and strength at Brown University next season."
98,2012,Adam Gilmour,"Has size and a good all-around game based on his exceptional skating, balance, and stick skills. Plays on both PP and PK, and is a reliable player everywhere on the ice. He projects as both a center and a winger."
96,2012,Ben Thomson,"3rd year eligible power forward type who always is willing to drop them. His physicality and edginess make him a perfect candidate to go to the net and engage in the battle areas as well as the wall of the attack zone. More than doubled his points totals, but as of yet, has not contributed with the amount of goals everyone expected."
102,2012,Rhett Holland,"Solid defender who shows all the tools to continue his progression as a solid defenseman. May not have the flash & dash of many of the D-men who will be picked early, but he is a workhorse at a lower tier who has benefitted by big minutes. Calm and solid in his own end, due to his feel and extremely good positioning. Closes gaps and uses his quick stick and makes life difficult for the attackers down low. Decent mobility for a bigger man. Very good breakout passer who has a good stretch pass. Logs minute on the PP.  His offensive game at this point is based on his passing, as his shot is below average. Named to the Canada West roster for the 2011 World Junior 'A' Challenge, and tried to set the tempo with hard hits in each game."
95,2012,Josh Anderson,"Potential power winger who plays the off-wing. Scored a hat trick in his first game. Spent the summer working with ex-NHLer, now trainer, Gary Roberts and is blossoming due his strong release and pretty good fists."
92,2012,Matia Marcantuoni,"Explosive player with great lateral agility and a hidden gear. A fine forechecking center that can close down on opposing players before they know the puck has been turned over. His hands and skills give him plenty of opportunities to show he can work the puck at top speed. Has the ability to use his skills at high speed, but his diagnosing skills of where he should lead the attack are a work in progress. His year was marred by injuries making him a true projection, and his selection depends upon when an NHL team feels it need to call his name."
91,2012,Daniil Zharkov,"Has shown good stick-handling skills to go along with his size. A quick, short strider who needs a bit more technique with the feet. Has a decent shot but is a more of a passer than shooter at this point."
94,2012,Brady Vail,"Drafted two seasons ago by Montreal but didn't sign and has re-entered the draft. Strong, big developmental prospect who projects as a wing, but has seen time at center. Made huge strides this season in creating more chances, and gave a more determined effort throughout games. Has a set of gears and a very good skill level, which he has now balanced with a good defensive game. He is now playing with an edge and confidence. Excellent defensive player at forward who diagnoses well and can break up plays. There was talk about him having an attitude and also that he wasn't keeping in game shape with conditioning."
89,2012,Brendan Leipsic,Undersized center-wing with good offensive instincts and excellent feet who sees action in various roles. A smaller man who thinks he is much bigger and thus cannonballs around fearlessly.
90,2012,Ben Johnson,"Elite skater, strong puck-handler, and good passer. Was voted co-holder of the Michigan Mr. Hockey award for the top high school player with Gerald Mayhew. Graduated to Windsor, where he is one of the first on PK, and uses his grit along with his speed to apply strong pressure. Relished the role as a shut-down defensive player, and uses his speed to throw himself into the fray, and also to get in the lanes and break up the attacks. He is small-framed and gets bounced around at this point, but there is no taking away his ability to play at a high energy level with success. Must get bigger and stronger."
86,2012,Colton Parayko,Big defender with improving foot speed. Has a cannon from the point. A long term developing player who must continue to play fast and strong as he gets comfortable with his height.  Does he need more bite to be a pro?
84,2012,Steven Hodges,"His increased workload this season saw him achieving positive results. A meat and potatoes three-zone guy who takes the body and gets into battles in the dirty areas. Just coming into his own, but already a good teammate."
88,2012,James Melindy,"Big Newfoundlander who skates well and has an emerging physical game, but also likes to carry the mail. Raw but improving in all three zones. Building proficiency with his transition game, and is a good passer. He diagnoses attackers well. Really raw but there is much to like and develop."
82,2012,Jarrod Maidens,"Promising offensive prospect who has shown he is a puck magnet, based on all of the hard work he does to cause turnovers. His good balance, good size, and good speed let him emerge from nowhere to find a puck on his stick or put himself in position to take one away.  Center with a powerful stride, excellent speed once he's moving, and a strong heavy shot. Plays with some bite and has elite stick skills. Is more man than boy in terms of body sculpt, and has upside potential. Emerging player who may rise up draft lists by June."
79,2012,Chris Calnan,Larger wing who causes problems for the opposition at both ends. A very good forechecker and shows decent enough passing and shooting abilities to think that he can ascend the ladder to pro. Has a strong wrist shot and is a good skater who has some grit to his game.
186,2013,Joel Vermin,"Small winger with versitility and quickness and fearlessness. Will he be the new ""Rat?"""
80,2012,Jake Paterson,"Good size, great glove, quick movement and a good feel for reading the attackers. Technically solid and improving."
77,2012,Chandler Stephenson,"Undersized speedy scorer who possesses an excellent shot. Strong skater who despite his smaller build can handle action against bigger defenders. He reads the play well, makes the right pass, and works the corner cycle with authority.  Already functionally strong, but he needs to get bigger, because at this point, he projects as feet-and-gun to the high levels.  Will need time."
81,2012,Oskar Sundqvist,Big Swedish center who already has two-way commitment and offensive upside. Sleeper.
76,2012,Chris Driedger,"Tall goaler who is in the developmental stage, but shows strong technique and upside."
83,2012,Matt Murray,"Net-minder with strong technique and presence as his team's load-carrier.  Squares up but maintains his coverage and takes few chances outside the paint. After a so-so year in the OHL, he opened eyes with his stellar performances at the Under-18 World Juniors."
75,2012,Jon Gillies,Huge strong-legged butterfly goaler with fast pads and a strong lower net presence.
71,2012,Tanner Richard,"Shifty speed player who had experience playing against men in the Swiss A league. Stronger than his slight build appears, he is a shifty puck carrier who can beat defenders one on one with his stick. Also uses power in the corners and along the wall. He plays smart and is the first guy in, ready to place hard hits on the forecheck. His defense is a work in progress but he is a gifted offensive player. He is an offensive generator at even strength who may become more of a goal-scorer once he is thicker and stronger."
73,2012,Justin Kea,"Son of former NHLer, Ed, he is a long-term project who needs to get quicker all-around. He is strong on his skates and provides a physical presence, and pots the occasional big goal. Still has a ways to go though to be considered a offensive threat. He may project to wing down the road."
70,2012,Scott Kosmachuk,"Rising prospect with excellent speed, toughness, and two-way game. Plays strong on the puck and displays a fierce willingness to go into battle areas determined to do damage. Anchors well in the crease area. May not be a blazer, but still shows several gears at his speed enough to be a deceptive attacker that defenders have trouble with. He will drop the gloves if necessary, play both penalty kill and power play, and has a high skill set."
72,2012,Troy Bourke,"Small, fearless, shifty centerman with good hockey sense and elusiveness. He makes up for his lack of size with good functional all-around strength. He plays in all situations on the power play, scoring or checking lines, or as a penalty killer. It remains to be seen if teams will call his name in early rounds due to his lack of size and limited upside."
68,2012,John Draeger,"Big solid prep school defender with good reach size and physicality. Good all-around game, but will need added jump and quickness that the weight room may facilitate. Has committed to Michigan State University."
74,2012,Esa Lindell,"Big thick player with significant upside. Needs a step or two to get going, and will need to be more agile and again mobility. He is an interesting long-term project. Was part of the Finnish U-18 team that dominated at the 5-Nations Tournament. He had five points and did a stellar job defensively."
67,2012,Mackenzie MacEachern,"Tall scorer who is working on improving his speed and strength. Was named the Most Valuable Player in the Michigan Interscholastic Hockey League as a high school junior. Committed to his team in the hopes of a state championship, instead of opting for a tougher competitive level with Sioux Falls in the USHL. He is a large kid who is a good skating long-strider with acceleration, quick feet, and more than one gear. Strong on the puck, with a good hard shot and release."
66,2012,Jim Vesey,"Second year eligible who displays a high hockey intelligence, great stickhandling abilities, and is a very good passer. Great on-ice sense, improved skating and strength. At belmont Hill, he was an extraordinary goal scorer and set up guy. Possesses a strong backhander and a quick forehand release. Can make things look easy with a knack for being in position to attack the net."
64,2012,Tim Bozon,"The Swiss-born wing, son of former NHL'er Philippe Bozon is a playmaker and scorer who is in his first season playing the North American-smaller rink style. He is a puck carrier, who likes to shoulder setting up in the offensive zone and has experience playing all three forward positions. He is a work in progress and he learns the nuances of the coverage and faster-paced play."
63,2012,Jujhar Khaira,"South Asian heritage C/LW who is a bigger mobile forward with a good all-around game and excellent shot. Positionally sound, reads the play, and has a quick release on an improving shot. He is still one more year away from college and will make a nice long term development player, who needs to improve his foot speed to go along with his tempered aggression. He loves the heavy-going and so may the NHL team that drafts him."
60,2012,Damon Severson,"Another of the tremendous ""Dub"" crop who is quietly developing into a strong prospect. He brings size, a strong two-way game, and some toughness. He is showing that he has an offensive side from the point or as the jump up guy. A good skater with a bit of speed, but what stands out is how good he is at playing the defensive part of his game."
61,2012,Devin Shore,"Developing scorer with patience, dangle, and good hands. Goes to the front, and reads the attack well. He doesn't have a great first step but his long stride is able to be seen once he is moving."
62,2012,Joonas Korpisalo,"Long term project who has good size, displays good styles in developing his game, and moves well laterally. Uses his stick well, but his average size may work against him."
59,2012,Boo Nieves,"Big College Freshman who already has pro-style size, but hasn't played against stiffer competition. He still has room to fill out further. Teams eye his smooth, quick stride that lets him move well in all directions with unusual agility for a bigger player. He moves laterally and gets scoring opportunities, and will not hesitate to drive to the net. Has top-end gears but he must develop the hands of a scorer, and expectations are that he will be more physical. An excellent passer, who quickly moves to open ice after passing the puck. Has seen some time at center and can generate offense with an opportune pass when defenders converge. Still not showing dominance at the level he is playing, so right now he is viewed as a long-term project with significant upside. Projects as a big winger."
184,2013,Saku Salminen,Big raw Finnish forward who projects as a power forward. A long term project who will need time to develop both his scoring and coverage. Intriguing player who might get selected based on his upside.
183,2013,Wilhelm Westlund,"Solid defense-first player who plays all phases very very well, but not an elite offensive standout. Averaged sized player with a more simple game that effectively gets his team out of trouble with good decision-making and the clean outlet pass. His skating allows him to have a good offensive game moves the puck well and is fairly careful to never do too much in the attack zone. Still far from polished, with he will have to gain power in the legs and improve further defensively. He was selected to the roster for the World Junior Under-18 Tournament in April."
179,2013,Blaine Byron,"Shifty skilled puckhandler with long stride, speed, vision, and playmaking skills. Can operate at top speed while in possession.  Plays the point on the PP. Very thin and needs weight and muscle. Slick puckhandler who can make plays at high speed. A long strider who looks to teammates but has excellent quickness and acceleration to beat opponenets one-on-one. Can man a point on the PP. Clearly stood out as the top Canadien player in the World junior A Challenge. His downside at this point would be his thin frame and lack of girth. He also needs a 60 minute commitment.He needs strength and teams will also be weary of selecting him because his success has come playing against Tier Two opponents,"
65,2012,Adam Pelech,"Big stay-at-home defender who plays a reliable safe game. Physical player who skates well and hits hard. He is a good skater and shows some offensive ability, but needs work on his quickness and pivots. He uses his reach and size to his advantage. He is a strong passer and also has some rushing abilities."
177,2013,Miro Aaltonen,"Smaller buzz-bomb of an attacker who gets on the opposition so well they start to resent it. Using his great balance and speed, he takes pucks away, and never stops working back into his own zone. Has a shot and is simply difficult to play against. The second year eligible suffered a devasting ankle injury during the opening game of the World Junior for team Finland. He was arguably their leader and one of the top players. Undersized but already a successful scorer and regular in the Finnish pro league playing against men. Father was a Finnish pro player. This is his third and last year of eligibility."
69,2012,Daniel Altshuller,"Developing prospect who is a rookie in the OHL, after leading team Ontario to victory in last year's U-17 challenge and Team Canada to gold in the summer's Ivan Hlinka tourney. He displays excellent lateral quickness and decision-making skills that he has coupled with his strong athleticism."
180,2013,Anton Blidh,He was selected to the roster for the World Junior Under-18 Tournament in April.
178,2013,Zack Leslie,"Improving two-way defenseman whose offensive skill-set has not completely come together. Shows good feet and a bit of rushing ability. Has good agility and mobility, and projects as a youngster who has good offensive instincts, but will need time for overall development."
169,2013,Marc McNulty,"Huge defenseman who continues to improve foot speed in his quest to be a shut-down defender. Skates better than you would expect such a big kid. Makes the smart pass out of his end, and has recorded multi-point games. big men that move like this cannot be ignored,  where the problem lies, is he is someone who project as a stay at home defender at the higher levels, but his present game is not one that displays a big man throwing his weight or showing ruggedness. He in fact looks soft, and uninterested in that role. Still, there is time for an awakening."
84,2011,Alan Quine,"Smart skilled playmaker with excellent skill package. All-around good skating abilities, soft hands and touch. Not just a passer, as he stays involved in all three zones, using his quick feet and head to push the game in his team's favor. Already committed to all three zones-it is just a matter of him getting functionally stronger as he climbs the ladder."
165,2013,Markus Söberg,Norwegian wing with off the charts quickenss and acceleration. An offensive generator who may develop into a scorer in his own right.
171,2013,Tommy Veilleux,Displays a strong work ethic and aggressive compete style. A wrecking ball is difficult to play against and is always ready to drop'em too. Must improve skating; short choppy steps and is missing a strong first step. Projects as a defensive forward with edge and grit.
167,2013,Avery Peterson,"One of the top Minnesota prospects he is a smart centre-forward who plays a strong two-way game. He plays as strong passing centre with a power game and three zone responsibility, and could also project to the wing. Has a frame with room to fill out into, and already plays physical. at his present size. Strong on the wall with a really nice shot. Shoews some dangle. If his hands improve, so will his chances to advance up the ladder."
161,2013,Chris Leblanc,Plays for the South Shore Kings i (USPHL)
168,2013,Quentin Shore,"College player who is not the fastest guy, but one of the most relentless. His take no prisoners aggressive style leads to turnovers. A defensive specialist, and not much offensive upside."
163,2013,Brendan Burke,"Arizona born goaltender who shared almost equal time with veteran starter Mac Carruth and accumulated four shut-outs and 24 wins this past season. Still developing, but has the size and athleticism NHL teams now seem to covet."
159,2013,Sean Malone,Speedy centreman who plays well in tight space. Excellent speed and gears to blow by even the best of junior defenders. Can cut on a dime and handle plays at his top gear after. Defensively responsible and always quick back to his own end on dee. Persistent forechecker. Really good release on his shot. His speed and relentless motor makes him a fine prospect.
151,2013,Gage Ausmus,"At this point, a solid stay at home defender who shows some two-way abilities. Quick enough to carry the puck and jump into the play, and tough enough to handle big forwards. he is a developing work in progress."
154,2013,Henri Ikonen,"Second year eligible OHL import who has decent size and good straight line quickness, with strong strides and balance. Have shown he can work the cycle and has adjusted well to the North American style. Projects as a wing. Strong goal line presence."
160,2013,Myles Bell,"Started his junior career as  promising offensiveman at this juncture, but some off ice issues has retarded his selection chances in the two past seasons. Offense is his game, but in no way a one trick pony though. Has some gumption to throw the big check, and is working on being a better positionally strong defender. If you're buying, it is because of his abilities going up-ice and his long passing skills. Makes stickhandling and passing look easy. Huge point shot."
150,2013,Wiley Sherman,"Huge stay-at-home defender who basically plays within the confines of his zone. His size allows him to close the gaps, use his stick to clog the lanes and pushes attackers to the outside. Skates well laterally. Needs to play much more aggressively, and his skating must catch up to his growth.  Fluid for a big man and if he grows a bit of a mean streak, the team selects him gets a big, nasty defense-first defender."
147,2013,Grant Besse,"Smaller, speedy forward who is a goal scorer. In his first two years of high school he scored 30 goals and 50 points in each year. Led his team by scoring all five goals in the Minnesota Class 2A boys’ hockey championship game. He has committed to the University of Wisconsin."
146,2013,Patrik Bartosak,The Czech Republic import made a strong showing all season with a plus .900 save percentage and kept Red Deer in games even in rebuild after their loss of Ryan Nugent-Hopkins to the big leagues. He was  passed on again last draft and is in his final draft eligible year.
143,2013,Anthony Florentino,"Sleeper who is quietly climbing up the draft lists. He is a solidly built room for filling out three zone defenseman who has shown he can check and clear with ruggedness and hurt. He possesses a good point shot and one-timer, as he learns the nuances of the way NHL power plays now attack. Is a very good long passer in transition. Rugged player with a  heavy shot. Wins the battles down low, but his feet have to get lighter, and needs a bit more lateral agility. A strong physical player all over the sheet and especially noticiable in the corners and the front, expect his name to be called, and a patient team may have a real find. can separate attackers from the puck. An offensive side may come at a later date."
145,2013,Anton Cederholm,Mobile Swedish dee-man who has an excellent size/skill ratio and good feet. Sound in alll phases and upside to progress into a big contributor.
139,2013,Mitchell Wheaton,"Big stay-at-home defenseman who chose the Rockets over many U.S. University scholarships he was offered. Wants to be a hockey player and will work hard and improving all parts of his game. Already over 225 pounds. Big, but docile. He gets picked apart and skaters blow by him, because he hasn't perfected his turns and hasn't even caught up to the WHL speed."
141,2013,Michael Brodzinski,"Both of his parents have played the game. At this point, he is under 6 foot, but growing. Has a huge shot. Possesses speed, agility, and soft hands and uses his gifts to play a simple but solid game. Good skater who will need work as adjust to the speed of the higher levels of play, he nonetheless likes the puck and jumping into the play. Plays tough, and when he plays under control, is an effective defender. Committed to the University of Minnesota."
144,2013,Blake Heinrich,"Fireplug defender who displays great feet, vision, and excellent puckhandling skills. His high point totals indicate the offensive end of his game, but his thick under 5' 11"" frame and almost 200 lbs. of girth are what opponents feel when they get close."
134,2013,Luke Johnson,"Longer term forward prospect who will need to get stronger and develop a bit, but nonetheless shows some skill and a super-quick release, excellent vision and hockey sense. Good face-off skills. Needs to engage the opposition and react to the game with a stronger competitiveness. Still plays too small."
135,2013,Eric Roy,"A miner's son, who is a big defender with good offensive ability and a solid work ethic. Has the size and willingness to play with physicality besides displaying good offensive skills, soft hands and great patience. Is able to close the gap on attacking junior players, but still needs plenty of improvement on his defensive game, with lateral mobility and footwork being essential. Teams will see the parts of his game that are already in place and decide what his high water mark is. Plenty to like in this emerging longer term project."
138,2013,Vincent Dunn,"One of the younger players available, he has proven to be a solid contributer in the offensive game in and out, besides managing to rile the opposition with his feistiness. He possesses a strong heavy shot, and acts as a distrurber in the attack zone, with the opposition taking notice of where he is. He hits hard and often. Blocks shots. Didn't look good in the QMJHL playoffs due to his long list of bad penalties. Still young and working to be a complete player. A sleeper in terms of final draft ranking. He displays enough upside that his name may be called earlier than anticipated."
136,2013,Viktor Crus-Rydberg,Thick centre-forward who plays an excellent two-way game with smarts and good vision. Strong on the puck and solid on his skates he is an excellent wall player in the cycle who shows offensive upside. He was selected to the roster for the World Junior Under-18 Tournament in April.
133,2013,Conner Clifton,"One of the yoiunger draft eligible players, he played  on the gold-medal-winning team in the August  at the Five Nations Cup, before heading to Russia in November for another U-17 tournament title in the Four Nations Cup. A physical player who makes his presence felt with big hits in each contest, he is an excellent skater who looks to be an excellent long term prospect, depsite being a a bit updersized at this point. He plays big."
140,2013,Teemu Kivihalme,"His all-around skill set and abilities project him as an excellent long-term developmental defenseman. Not flashy, but all around effective in all phases. e plays with a high compete level and physicality you expect from much bigger defenders. Four direction mobility guy who shows as much aggression on dee as he does jump in transition. He is a good shooter too. Has excellent speed and mobility and closes gaps very well. Solid in his end, where he will work the wall hard. Has a good wide frame with room to fill it in. His smooth skating combined with good stick-handling and passing ability provide him with the tools to work the transition.  Commited to Colorado College."
130,2013,Gustav Possler,"Developing scoring wing who displays ability to make plays in high gear. Has a quick jump and although not a real lateral player, weaves well in traffic. Reads coverages and gets open. Plays strong on the puck when pressured, and can be clever when called upon to be. He is more a finisher than set up guy, and is very disciplined to get back in transition and back check for pucks. At this juncture isn't strong enough to dominate, but when he is, he may be good pro up & down North-South skater with ability to pot some goals and provide opportunistic scoring chances on the attack."
131,2013,Cole Ully,"Deceptive scorer and playmaker who can take care of business at high speed. Smaller player who is still adapting to playing against the bigger WHL veterans. He needs continued weight training and girth. Has soft hands, and is a smooth passer on the attack."
123,2013,Will Butcher,"Skilled defenseman whose stick-handling, skating, and passing abilities are exceptional, but stride & foot speed are average. Nonetheless, he shows quarterback ability and good offensive upside, despite his smaller stature. Sees time as a PP QB, due to his excellent vision and hockey smarts. The question is can he improve upon it and actually be able to do the same in the pro game. He was selected to the roster for the World Junior Under-18 Tournament in April."
126,2013,Brent Pederson,"Longer term project who has natural scoring ability and a bit of aggression. Finishes his checks and has very good balance. Needs improvement on his defensive game, and to build his attack skills and plan."
120,2013,Ryan Fitzgerald,"An undersized centreman who plays fast and has continually performed well in big games. Excellent face off man, passer and shooter. Quick release, anticipation in the attack and vision. He is an unselfish two-way pivot who sees the ice extraordinarily well and sets things up so smoothly and abundantly. Has a lightning release, good defensive zone coverage and committment, and despite his size, looks like an excellent up and comer.   Good penalty killer. His father Tom is a former NHLer."
129,2013,Cal Petersen,U. S. Team goaltender with good size and over all athleticism and lateral mobilty in the crease. Needs plenty of time and work on his game before being considered a major league contender. Has nice tangibles and willingness to work hard. Tracks pucks well. Needs time.
119,2013,Ryan Segalla,"Goods hitter with decent feet and physicality, but will need to improve in all phases, including his on-ice feel for the tempo, and his passes."
117,2013,Fredrik Bergvik,Ice-water Swedish goaler with size and confidence. long-term developmental goalie prospect with upside.
125,2013,Saku Mäenalanen,"Second year eligible winger with good feet, burst, agility who has caught up with to his growth spurt and has shed the awkwardness that was present earlier. He was selected to the roster for the World Junior Under-18 Tournament in April, and it provided him with platforn to show his improvements as a possible NHLer player due to his all around versatibilty. big body that finishes checks, and plays a robust all-in style combined with some offensive upside. He may not project as a high end guy, and needs to get stronger, but he may eventually be able to slide up & down through the bottom nine."
127,2013,Tucker Poolman,Rangy defender who has shown glimpses of offensiev attack skills and improved play in his own end. A long term project who will need to fill out and continue to get better all-around to play a jump to the pros.
118,2013,Hudson Fasching,"Strong skating high character power wing who could be a dominating player down the road. He has a really quick stick and and an excellent snap shot. High Hockey IQ, he is already a great wall player at 6 foot 3, 190. His all-around skill level is well above average and he shoots the puck, passes the puck, and chases the puck like a future NHLer. Displays excellent ability when in tight on goalmouth flurries. Needs a bit more development time, but is a fine long term prospect. He was selected to the roster for the World Junior Under-18 Tournament in April. Committed to the University of Minnesota."
115,2013,Jordan Subban,"Puck-moving defenseman who is positionally strong on his skates and an excellent puck-handler. Undersized and in need of more muscle, he is a gambler type, who is a high risk-high reward player. Great moving laterally. Has a tendency to force the play with individual efforts over the safe play. If he grows, he will fly up the draft boards."
116,2013,Martin Reway,"Smaller speedy Czech centreman who is an excellent passer and offensive generator. Small, but determined. Strong on the puck and physically strong for his size, enabling him to play as if he were a bigger man. Aggressive - gave Team Canada in the world juniors a taste of his stick on numerous occasions. Tough disadvantaged kid who had to grow up through challenged life situtations and is still polishing his social skills. The right organization might polish this youngster inot a diamond."
121,2013,Tyler Motte,"Centre with good puckhandling skills who likes to be the puck carrier, and offensive generator. Has always been a prolific scorer at the early competition levels.  Good character and competitor who is always called upon to be on the ice to bring his team back from deficits, with his speed, lateral agility, and puck skills. Plays big. As many young players, his defensive game needs more commitment, from both on-ice play, to his game analysis and reaction. Committed to the University of Michigan."
58,2012,Jordan Martinook,Big third year eligible who has developed his skating and quickness and scored 40 goals with Vancouver (WHL).
54,2012,Mike Winther,"At this point, he projects as a possible bottom six roster player for an NHL club based on his smarts, grit, willingness to play in the dirty battle areas, and skills. He surpassed his goal totals at the halfway point of the season, and time will tell if he can continue his upward spiral. Battles hard for pucks against any sized opponents. Excellent defensive player whose improving skill set could see him develop higher than a bottom two-line projection if he builds scoring prowess equal to his elite level skills."
53,2012,Brian Hart,"Emerging power winger with soft hands and a very good shot. He uses his strength and speed to do strong work on the wall and other battle areas. A well-balanced skater with good jump. Displays patience with the puck. Has soft hands and a heavy shot. Drives the net, stands in front and is good on tip-ins. A rising prospect."
52,2012,Teodors Bluegers,"Latvian import took a prep-school to World Junior Tourney jump where he displayed excellent face-off ability, strong wall drive, and strong offensive-zone savviness. Really good passer. Has a good shot, and knows how to get open for the puck."
50,2012,Colton Sissons,"Kelowna's Captain has high hockey IQ, and a great three-zone game. Relentless in puck pursuit, he is more of a wing who can project up and down the lines due to his high-energy play, slick passes, and big-time shot. Presently a first line player in Kelowna as a center. He has a big time shot, good speed, an aggressive game, and plenty of character."
51,2012,Dalton Thrower,"Tough battler who plays strong on his skates and has some offensive ability. Not tall but wide. Fearless defenseman who plays an intense style that brings bad news to attackers who attempt to occupy the crease or venture into the corners. Good open ice body-checker. Plays strong on his skates, and keeps his position. Expertly makes the outlet and is also willing to move up in the rush. Another defensive prospect from the Dub, except he is a defender who can run the power play, throw big aggressive checks, and is always willing to drop'em."
122,2013,Chris Clapperton,"Second year eligible wing hwo is slight, but has taken a big jump in terms of development, and over-all play. Attended Philadelphia Flyers prospects camp and scored a hat trick in a scrimmage. Lots to like in this QMJHL player who has been a strong player on the Armada his entire junior career."
56,2012,Sam Kurker,"Larger wing who causes problems for the opposition at both ends. A very good forechecker. Shows decent passing and shooting abilities, enough to think that he can ascend the ladder to the pros. Has a strong wrist shot and is a good skater who has some grit to his game. Is at his best when going North-South and playing physical. He has committed to Boston University."
47,2012,Brock McGinn,"Physical forward whose two brothers, Tye and Jamie have already been drafted. Missed almost seven weeks with a broken wrist. Not the biggest guy, but plays big. A very good skater with quickness, gears, and lateral agility that make him a noticed forechecker and player that puts pressure on the defense. Has a good shot."
57,2012,Alexandre Mallet,3rd year eligible forward who developed scoring abilities after originally thought of as strictly a physical force.
49,2012,Martin Frk,"Czech winger is just a bit over six feet but plays in juniors like an elite power forward and scorer. He moves well and is a hard worker, always willing to muck down low and play hard in the battle areas. Has a bit of a choppy stride but it doesn't impede his strong propensity to engage and bother the enemy. Displays good vision, great functional strength, a super quick trigger and deadly hard wrist shot. Passes well on both fore & backhand. Learning to play better defensively, he has good set-up and attack skills on the other end. He is physical and plays hard in every game. May lack the skating ability and defensive commitment to be given an opportunity to play in the top six, despite having one of the deadliest cannons in this draft. In preseason, he suffered a concussion that shortened his season considerably, and his ultimate draft rank will depend upon where teams see his long term hockey health, along with his commitment."
55,2012,Chris Tierney,"On a London Knight team that boasts seven legitimate centers, and needs to shift three of them to the wing, he plays center and plays against many of the top OHL lines."
45,2012,Anthony Stolarz,"Giant goalie who is getting lots of buzz concerning his long term projectability, due to his quickness, eye for the puck, and athletic make-up."
48,2012,Dillon Fournier,"A raw-boned rearguard who will need to get stronger, but exhibits natural ability and great North-South-East-West feet that aid in his defensive game. He thinks defense first and closes down on attackers and displays an aggressive nature in all three zones. His offensive side is developing. He can skate it out and can make the outlet pass under pressure. Needs work on PP skills but is an intriguing prospect."
44,2012,Jake McCabe,Some say being paired with Justin Schultz at Wisconsin made him appear better than he is. The truth is he has a strong stand-alone game and is an effective player all over the ice. Good developing defender with high hockey IQ in all phases and will be able to develop into a defender who can handle NHL attackers.
41,2012,Mitch Heard,"Feisty 3rd year eligible center-wing who scored 29 goals with the powerhouse Whalers. Wasn't drafted last year, but attended Leafs prospects camp last August and has gotten bigger and better since looking like a scorer at camp. Plays every shift like it's his last, with aggression and abandon."
40,2012,Dylan Blujus,Huge defensive rearguard who puts in an honest effort each game. Needs work on his skating as he has heavy feet. Gets plenty of minutes on both specialty teams. Heavy accurate point shot. Nice long term project.
42,2012,Patrick Sieloff,Solid rearguard who has a willingness to jump up in the play. Can play at a very fast pace and shows an excellent skill set including soft hands and tremendous 4-way skating ability. Smart passer who is steady and effective. A heady open-ice hitter who leaves a mark along the wall too.
43,2012,Ludvig Byström,"Another Swedish defensive prospect who has good long term potential, but is far from the polished product. He displays excellent all-direction feet and makes poise puck decisions, has good vision and very good passing ability. His skating must continue to improve, but he is already smart positionally, and closes down well. Takes the body when needed and, although not a real up-ice guy, he is cool on the point, strong at passing, and good getting to loose pucks."
39,2012,Lukas Sutter,The son of Rich Sutter is a defense-first physical forward and an above-average face-off man. Great hockey IQ but low pro ceiling as a possible third liner. His offensive game is improving and his heart will never be questioned. Moving up the lists.
35,2012,Matt Finn,"Solid decision maker who shows good defensive abilities. Positions himself well in his zone and is showing improved offensive capabilities. He is generating more chances with his puck work and is showing he can provide complimentary scoring. One of the younger draftees,  he is a minute eater on the backline, often logging 18-20 minutes per game in all situations. Although not overly tall, he handles the defensive side well due to improved dedication to conditioning. His on-ice decisions have help rocketed his point totals, as he now jumps in, stays back, contains, and times his hits so that there is little risk taking."
37,2012,Pontus Aberg,"Scoring wing with change of pace speed, deceptive shooting skills, and the willingness to play in the dirty areas. Very responsible in his own end and is strong on the puck when carrying. A difficult player to contain when he is on his way to the net, because his determination drives him. Hard worker who has excellent vision, quick feet and lateral agility, as well as a fearless demeanor as he finishes his checks. Always moving and looking for rebounds and deflections. Has little problem in traffic, and causes headaches to defend against, as he owns the wall and front, and makes no friends along the way. Despite looking young in the Swedish pro league, he is a hugely aggressive forward with tremendous upside."
46,2012,Raphael Bussieres,Two-way player with terrific feet. Deft puck-handler who can beat defenders from the outside. Good offensive generator who needs to show consistency both in the offensive & defensive phases. Needs to be more involved when the puck isn't in his possession. Does show willingness to drop the gloves.
36,2012,Nicolas Kerdiles,"Not the fastest skater but is an essential part of his team's success. He is very strong and is asked to engage in the corner battles and wall work. Plays gritty every night and has the ability to score in close or from the areas near the front.  More quick than fast. A good finisher, he places the puck well with his shots. He is possibly worthy of a first round selection, if the team choosing him sees continued success, commitment, and upside in his offensive abilities. If not, you get a player who is a natural scorer, but lacks big parts to his game, thus limiting his ice-time if not corrected."
38,2012,Phillip Di Giuseppe,"Agile wing with excellent skills, speed, and good feet.  He was a noticeable player in the NHL Research and Development Camp. Strong for his size and will carry defenders because he doesn't stop driving. Good in corners and along the wall. He is an improving defensive zone guy too."
31,2012,Oscar Dansk,"Cool, quick-legged, butterfly goalie who displays strong positioning, good balance, and has size to the top of the net. The top goalie available from Sweden. Lets the play come to him, anticipates well, and is pretty agile, so he recovers well. Very sharp and in control during games and forces shooters to commit by being more patient than they are. Gives few rebounds and has great feet to reposition himself quickly. Teams are not only familiar with him because his performance at last summer's Ivan Hlinkla tourney, but also because he was a member of the Shattuck St. Mary's program before returning to Sweden to hone his skills there."
32,2012,Mitchell Moroz,"Tough, good skating wing who is always ready to drop them, but hasn't had progress in his offensive game. Has a decent skill set and projects as a power winger, once he adds a bit of speed and can concentrate on not doing too much."
34,2012,Ville Pokka,"Two-way Finn defender who takes the body on the wall and slot. He passes the puck really well, and is an effective distributor no matter where he is on the ice. Good PP puck distributor who has really good  one-timer. Doesn't possess star level ability, but has great upside. Still might cave under pressure, but it takes a lot to rattle him to the point of a major mistake. By far not a complete finished product, but plenty to like about his upside. Must work to get his feet moving quicker, and make better decisions in his defensive zone. Carries the biscuit as well as anyone."
27,2012,Henrik Samuelsson,"Son like father…and then some. Daddy Ulf patrolled the NHL defense with snarl, making no friends. Young Henrik, a center-forward, has the size and a frame to add on to. His Journey had him follow his father to MoDo and the bigger ice of Sweden SEL, where he struggled adjusting to the different style. He was already man-sized but not able to play faster on the surface. A drop down to the U-20 level didn't help. I believe he lost confidence. The move to Sweden meant he gave up his NCAA eligibility. In December he recognized he needed to get back to North America and joined the Edmonton Oil Kings of the WHL. He plays a responsible 3 zone game, is strong on the puck, and is the bane of any wall; corner or crease. Despite the inefficiency he showed as a speed player on bigger ice, he nonetheless is strong on the puck, and has the ability to dash out of the corner with a powerful stride, but probably is unsuited at the center position. He projects as a future power forward with a heavy shot that he releases rapidly. Has very good stick skills and North-South speed. He needs work on lateral agility so his feet can take him to more areas where he can do damage. I believe the quickness will come with time. Did I mention that sonny boy also agitates his opponents to a high level of aggravation?"
33,2012,Sebastian Collberg,"Shifty game-breaking winger with a superior high-end gear that enables him to drive the net with power, but does so in spurts and may not be the effortless skater he was thought to be. He has a quick release, soft hands, quick feet, excellent passing skills, and a fearless demeanor. He consistently gives defensemen trouble with his speed moves and determination. His development is a matter of getting stronger and more prepared for the pro game."
30,2012,Tanner Pearson,"Third year-eligible Pearson developed into an every night competitor with size, good feet, and good offensive abilities off the rush. The puck seems to find him. He is a guy who may be considered average across the board in terms of size, feet, shot, but plays with a determined demeanor. Has good anticipation and a lightning quick release."
28,2012,Brady Skjei,"Fastest rearguard in the entire U.S. developmental program. When moving up ice, he creates scoring chances as a terrific transition player. Creative with the puck when he leads in. Very tricky on the offensive. Reads and reacts well, and has a strong defensive game. Effortless skating backward. Shows grit and willingness to punish the opposition. He has committed to the University of Minnesota."
23,2012,Michael Matheson,"Quebec native who is making noise as a 17-year old in the USHL. Strong offensive game, and solid defensively. Good on-ice vision and high-end carrying ability. Very quick footed and has more than one gear. Plays the power-play point with maturity, and with added strength his shot will gain mustard. The knock against him is that he can become a liability defensively when the games get feisty. Just isn't tough and determined in close games and seems to cave when pressure is applied. He is still sound in many instances and has time to further build a tougher game defensively. He committed to Boston College."
22,2012,Olli Maatta,"The concussion he suffered early in the World Junior Tournament has certainly placed a cloud around his slotting. After acting as the leader of the Finn Junior team in the August Ivan Hlnka Tourney, he made his way across the pond to the OHL's London Knights. He is an all-around defenseman that brings toughness and physicality in the defensive zone but rarely misses a chance in transition to rush up ice. One of the younger players in the draft, he is a powerful skater who makes the right decisions wherever he is and no matter how pressured he might be. His biggest strength is the consistency of his play, game in and game out. Displays good speed, vision, and stamina and plays hard no matter how much time is on the clock. He passes the puck with excellent accuracy, and has a heavy point shot. He battles and engages the opposition whenever he can, and is well versed at keeping the puck in the attack zone.  Heavy Point shot.  Although he is average in his first two steps, and less offensive-minded than many of the other D-men in this draft. He may get overlooked early, but he looks to be a fine long term prospect with significant upside, and showed as much in the Under-18 World Tourney in May."
25,2012,Jordan Schmaltz,"Great size/skill ratio, and great feet. Leads the rush into the attack zone and shows great confidence on offense. Still an unbridled pony in his own zone and needs to play under control. His lateral mobility, good feel, and hard shot make him a good power-play QB. His point shot rockets on net with little wind-up, and he displays a confident presence when he has the puck. He is a deft passer, carrier, and offensive generator. He has a quick stick, and sees the developing play like an elite pro, and is quick diagnosing and reading in all zones. He will need to add girth, strength and a bit more snarl, but he has the looks of an excellent prospect."
29,2012,Stefan Matteau,"Son of the former NHLer, he plays a hard-nose style that is similar. His physical play has been known to cause momentum swings in games. Sees the ice well, and reads situations well. He is more of a set-up guy than a scorer, and continued progress in that area may improve his draft standing. He has committed to North Dakota."
20,2012,Scott Laughton,"Reliable two-way forward who diagnoses well. Team leader and hard worker who shows some grit. He is good with the puck on the fly and plays solid defense coming back. He really hasn't shown much goal production this season, but that doesn't negate the upside that is there. Excellent forechecker who might improve as he gains strength. At the CHL Prospects Skills Competition he tied for the most accurate shot, but lost the tiebreaker."
18,2012,Teuvo Teravainen,"Undersized offensive wing who has outstanding jump and lateral agility that lets him dangle and lead to scoring chances. Needs to gain both weight room strength and more thickness. Besides his devastating shot, he has a well-balanced stride and a variety of gears. In international competition, he continues to strengthen the views that he is a highly elite scorer whose skills, toughness, and scoring prowess may outweigh his size. Later viewings have shown he has made a become firmly more committed to his work in the defensive zone. There is no denying the skill that comes in this smaller package."
17,2012,Tomas Hertl,"Arguably the best prospect in the Czech Extraleague, showing excellent offensive instincts and playmaking abilities. He makes up for lack of breakaway speed by being a balanced skater who plays strong on the puck and goes fearlessly into all attack areas getting him separation. Reads situations well and his decision-making skills are well above-average. Solid forecheck who usually finishes. He dangles really well, has great hands, and a great back-hand which he used to tie the USA in World Juniors in the middle period. He displays soft mitts and passes the puck really well in the offensive zone. Needs work defensively but is committed to improvement all around."
26,2012,Brendan Gaunce,"You don't need to look far to know he is a heavy shooting big bodied forward who has a good work ethic. He has decent hands and a strong hard shot. Creates scoring chances and wins puck battles, and willing to knock the opposition right off the puck. His skating is an area that he needs to improve as he needs a couple steps to get into stride, and needs more mobility. Granted he can close on opponents but needs to get a head of steam up. Is strong on the puck and protects it well. Displays good vision and creativity, but his defensive game is a work in progress. Will bring physicality at center, no matter how well he develops as a center. His selection slotting is completely dependent upon whether he projects as a second line NHL center by NHL scouting staffs, or 3rd or 4th line."
19,2012,Andrey Vasilevskiy,"Youngest player on the Russian's World Junior team, and arguably their best. Big, long-limbed athletic goalie who is at his best when there is lots of bodies near him. Covers much of the net and challenges the shooters well.  He bends over quite a lot and doesn't handle the puck terribly well, but shows good lateral quickness in post movement."
21,2012,Mark Jankowski,"Largely ignored by possible Canadian Major Junior leagues since he was much smaller, but then when he suddenly shot up in size, his skills weren't defined. Now he is a draft wild card that may even sneak in tho the early round. He has super-strong hockey bloodlines, as his great uncle is Red Kelly, his grandfather was a long time pro player then scout, his father was a college player and coach, and his uncle was a Montreal scout and assistant GM. Skilled center with excellent vision, poise, and speed. He hands the puck off as well as any prospect in this draft year. If he was born a couple days later, he would have had to wait until the 2013 draft to hear his name. High character athlete with a hungry competitive nature, and strong work ethic. Good stick and good hands, and skates with a smooth, long stride. Rising prospect may reap high rewards a few years down the line."
14,2012,Zemgus Girgensons,"A tough, skilled center who has an excellent scoring touch, great hockey sense, and soft hands. The Latvian born import projects as a power forward who can finish but excels in generating offense through his set-ups. He is a player who shows up every night and gives it all, with skills and feet that make him strong on the puck. In a draft year where defensemen clearly outweigh forwards in terms of polished players, he stands out in his class as a guy with significant upside as a potential two-way dominant center. He is at the very least three or four years from being NHL ready, so teams without immediate needs should hope that he is passed on by those looking for quicker additions to their roster."
16,2012,Thomas Wilson,"Punishing wing with decent hands and promise in slot anchoring. Skating is a work in progress but his impact as an imposing offensive corner punisher is undeniable. Not destined to be a 20-goal NHLer, but will have merit down low and in front, as he brings nastiness and grit."
11,2012,Filip Forsberg,"Another player who cemented his early selection after a terrific showing at the Ivan Hlinka Tourney.  One of the best younger players available, he possesses exceptional playing strength that allows him to play all phases with noticeable magnetism. He clearly is a finisher, but what stands out is his willingness to play with snarl in battle areas and even shows physicality beyond his age. His true talent lies in his strong stride, hands, and snap shot. Needs to add quickness and a stronger first step. Unfazed by contact, he continues rolling through opposing obstacles. May have huge upside as he continues to build his strength and game."
24,2012,Malcolm Subban,Brother of Habs defenseman
10,2012,Slater Koekkoek,"A taller player who has a nice size/strength ratio, and ability to jump into the rush. He is capable of adding intense snarl if appropriate, but tends to stick to the business. He is surprisingly quick for a bigger man with mobility and a very fluid stride. Displays good vision on the offensive power play.  He plays a safe game within his present abilities, but can surprise defenders with his speed from the point. He is certainly a prospect with plenty of room for growth and improvement. He already shows a hard quick shot. Koekkoek is a sleeper due to the fact that he didn't receive an invitation to the RDO camp, despite the fact his performance at the Ivan Hlinka tourney was outstanding. Their step-child treatment of him may result in some team getting a huge value later than our projection."
13,2012,Radek Faksa,"A ""veteran"" from the Czech U-20 league, who transplanted in the OHL with Kitchener. He is a versatile two-way player who is excellent with the puck as well as when going after it. Has above good straight line speed, passing and finishing skills. Despite some balance issues, he is strong on the puck, and a willing wall worker, who is good in traffic. A character player with good instincts, drive to the end, and willingness to work the wall. As with many youngsters, he needs to get stronger and improve his lateral skating and agility. He already shows good defensive zone commitment and is closer to NHL duty than most other forwards that will get selected in the first round."
7,2012,Mathew Dumba,"Strong wide-based skater whose knees and feet seem to never stop moving while in motion. A player who relishes collisions with opposing forwards.  Consistently moves up-ice and has the gun to let his cannon shot go from wherever he has positioned himself in the offensive zone after the rush. A good passer and clearly a team leader. He acted as the primary shutdown shadow when Canada needed to keep both Forsberg & Grigorenko at bay in the Ivan Hlinka Tourney in August. He doesn't possess blazing speed or much size, but comes to play. He hopefully will get stronger and bigger. He received some playing time at forward towards the end of the year because of his immense offensive abilities. He is going to have to get under control on defense and not think each opportunity with the puck is THE one that he needs to gamble on."
9,2012,Jacob Trouba,"Heaviest shot in the draft. Power-play general who can skate it out of his zone or be a trailer on the attack. Fluid skater with great feet and balance that will allow him to separate the puck from attackers. A poised player who keeps calm and focused in the heat of battle. Has consistently shown in international competitions that he can play against the best junior players in the world, even though they were older than him."
15,2012,Cody Ceci,"Big thick-framed player with plenty of upside. Plays both ends well, and with good physicality and picks his spots with timed collisions and wall-work. He has decent mobility and balance and plays a positionally sound game. PP distributor who throws hard checks on defense. He needs to get quicker on his feet and in his decision-making but looks like a prospect who may project as a dependable strong two-way defenseman. May be a bit closer to NHL-ready than most other defenders except for Murray."
8,2012,Derrick Pouliot,"A give-no-ground good skating defender from the WHL. An offensive defenseman whose defensive game will improve as he continues working hard at the little things.  He is working at being a better shut-down player. Already a very polished transition player, due to a good jump and excellent awareness of when to take off and create a mismatch. Already an outstanding point man, as he effectively reads and reacts with pro-like passing ability. He has a great feel about where he can distribute the puck and give his teammates the best scoring opportunities. Positions himself well in his own zone and can return aggression if necessary."
5,2012,Morgan Rielly,"A strong, balanced, quick-footed skilled defensive prospect who led the Canadian contingent at the Ivan Hlinka Tourney in August. Shows all-around abilities and good instincts to eventually anchor an NHL pairing due to a cool calmness when QB-ing the play. Skates with a nice stride, and can pivot or turn away from pursuers, while passing the puck to an open attacker. His game includes creativity while jumping in, good decisions defensively, and a growing offensive toolbox that allows him to play at a quick pace. He rarely turns pucks over, and always positions himself to close down the attackers. In this strong class of defenders, he clearly exhibits the best power-play quarterbacking skills, whether it is with a pin-point pass or a carry through and passed the crowd. Dynamic offensive puck carrier who makes going up ice look easy."
6,2012,Hampus Lindholm,"Smart, steady skater with a solid two-way game, but basically is a defender that quietly and effectively plays strong in his end. Very mobile and agile for a big man. Good in his own and especially down low. Showns his muscles along the wall and in clearing the crease. Rarely attempts much more than the safe play. Will get bigger and stronger. Already uses his size. Long term development still needed, but many things to like about him. He was excellent in the Under 18 World Junior Tourney in May."
12,2012,Mikhail Grigorenko,"Tremendous talent who also has left Russia to cement the notion that he would be willing to stick around and be signed and assigned to development in North America. Shows signs that he is an emerging dominant player based on his size, balanced skating, speed, power, and puck-handling ability. He is a player who gets the attention of the opposition as they focus on preventing him from getting chances. He moves effortlessly as he goes on the attack. He sees the ice well and generates chances while making room for his linemates. His all-around game and focus are a work in progress, as he can tend to focus only on the offensive side, forgeting the other things that are necessary. He also has be accused of notching down when games are out of reach. He led all first-year players in the league with 85 points and 40 goals, and was second in assists with 45. Not easy to move off the puck, he projects as another high level Russian import who can make an impact in the NHL either on wing or center. He was accused of again disappearing in the World Under-18, and afterward it was announced he was diagnosed with mononucleosis. An interesting parallel is in the 2007 draft, when Logan Couture was still on the board at slot nine, due to the fact he had a lackluster draft year after getting mono and never truly recovered for the entire season. The difference is Couture was never considered an on-ice Jeckyll-Hyde player. No one will argue with the fact that if this young man commits, his upside is huge."
3,2012,Alex Galchenyuk,"Some might try and say that the Milwaukee-born Galchenyuk's fortunes are exclusively tied to Yakupov, but that is far from a fair assessment. He is a smart, skilled player in his own right, and may be one of the most complete all-around players in the draft. He is already over 6 feet, and growing. Like his linemate, Yakupov, he also moves well, with balance and powerful stride and is strong on the puck. Both are scorers and offensive generators, and difficult to typecast as one over the other. Has a strong hard wrist shot, but his biggest strength is his great stick-handling skills. Both players basically provided most of their Sarnia Jr. team's offensive. Galchenyuk reads the ice and takes full advantage of the situations to control the flow of play. His on-ice awareness, which gets him to the proper spaces offensively and in the other two zones, only makes him more dangerous. Dangles as well as any player in the draft and his top-end speed and drive to the net are in no way tied to his line mate. Exceptional hockey IQ (his father was a pro player) and selfless line mate who approaches the game, practice and off-ice regime like he is already a pro. Has communicated his interest to represent the USA in competition, thus separating himself for the ""Russian signing factor."" His early season ACL tear will limit him to 6 games late in the year. Teams know of his commitment and skills. In a draft as strong as this one, it is hard to believe that teams may target others over him, but it is difficult to believe he isn't selected in the first round despite his serious injury."
4,2012,Griffin Reinhart,"Huge player with huge upside. A big man who skates exceptionally well and has turns. Moves laterally with the fluidity of an average size player. Very cool under pressure and a very good ice general whose vision allows him to make the right play. Rarely beaten one on one due to his size. He has a strong shot from the point and is excellent at reading where to go with the puck. Can pass the puck on offense better than most. His bread and butter is his ability to move the puck up ice using his speed and accurate passing. He uses his size to be an aggressive physical force in his defensive zone, making him a more attractive prospect, filled with upside. The fact that his father, Paul, was an NHLer doesn't hurt either."
114,2013,Jan Kostalek,"Growing defender with good instincts and toughness. An excellent European prospect who unfortunately broke his collarbone in November 2012, just as he started to excel at showing his offensive prowess. Good four direction skater with playmaking ability.  Has a bit of edge and is a pretty good open-ice checker. His draft status may be hindered by that fact, and that he is good in all phases but hasn't really shown superiority in any one area. He was selected to the roster for the World Junior Under-18 Tournament in April."
1,2012,Nail Yakupov,"Burgeoning elite player who has dynamic puck skills, excellent on-ice vision, speed and an accurate shot. Plays with an edge and enjoys the gritty aspects, making more than one opposing player remember his sweater number. He is consistently able to explode into bigger players and knock them off their feet due to powerful speed and balance.  Scored over a 100 points in his transition year into North American hockey, and it is expected his pace will not slow down. He is a finisher, first and foremost, but also reads the play and makes the right play with the correct pass. His skating is what sets him apart, enabling tremendous lateral mobility. His burst and hands, combined with him doing everything at top speed, also make him very difficult to defend against. When necessary, he can make defenders look silly when he rockets in. Has an entire toolbox of moves and shots, and a one-timer that is hard to stop. Was offered millions to stay in Russia, but chose to get his $160 dollars/month to make the transition to the North American style with one purpose in mind: Make it to the NHL is the fall of 2012. Top pick or first tier prospect."
2,2012,Ryan Murray,"Elusive offensive player who displays strong leadership and offensive prowess for his team. He is an instinctive up-ice attacker, who is tremendous in transition. A beautiful skating stride lets him put his offensive instincts to work. He is already polished well beyond his age in terms of understanding and accomplishing all on-ice tasks. There is a very strong possibility he plays in the NHL next season. Has a high skill level to match his head, and passes the puck extremely well. Has strong awareness and positioning in his defensive zone."
111,2013,Robin Norell,"He was selected to the roster for the World Junior Under-18 Tournament in April 2013, where the smaller defender showed he was a mobile puck mover  who passes the puck extremely well and displays solid awareness and composure in the defensive zone. Has excellent mobility and is above average in transition. Pivots well, and has shown he can engage and close on defense. Will have to get bigger and stronger but looks like a prospect with upside."
108,2013,Ben Harpur,Has only played defense for two seasons. Displays the physical tools to continue improve on the backline. Sees an occasional shift up front.
109,2013,David Pope,"Big Fluid winger who is a second year eligible player with skills. Had an injury-marred season partially due to his attempts to play like a heavyweight when his body is still at featherweight. Displays good hands, feet and  nice shot, but needs to get stronger and buk up to continue upward development. Must be viewed as a long term project. Headed to the U of Nebraska-Omaha."
105,2013,Nick Moutrey,"Big left-handed centre-wing who has some touch and is unafraid to stand up for his teammates.  His over-all game is a work in progress and his first two steps, and mobilty have him tycast already as more of a North-South guy that has to work to stay with the play. At this juncture, he gets in the battle araes and uses his size to out-muscle and work pucks free and cause havoc in front.  He does have decent hands too. He does his best to block shots and use his size in his defensive zone. A very willing combatant too. Teams will have to decide whether they think he can to be a better shooter and shooter as they decide on his slottng. Projects as that front cloggingcentre and willing disruptor."
102,2013,Tobias Lindberg,"Big Swedish who has seen work at all three forward positions. Had great success at the lower rungs of the Swedish leagues as a scorer, but projects more a third liner in the pros. A work in progress"
107,2013,Dylan Labbé,"Solid defender on a weak junior team. Very smart in all zones and patiently goes to work with the walls falling around him. Good gap control, strong puck handler, strong outlet passer and a growing ability to be a strong up-ice carrier."
110,2013,Ryan Graves,"Big defender who doesn't shy away from fights and the rough going. Was named the major midget league’s top rookie defenceman for the 2010-2011 major midget hockey season. Still developing and adjusting to the quicker pace of junior, he is nonetheless an excellent long term developmental prospect of defense."
101,2013,Nicholas Paul,Wing who is improving his over all speed and skating to go with his powerful stride. Displays good hands and stick. Excellent stick-handler and strong on the puck. Tough to play against and also can drop'em. A first year player who shows huge upside.
98,2013,Matt Buckles,"Big Centre-Forward who projects as a power with in the pros. Hard working player whose on-ice commitment is contagious.  He shows some scoring ability to go with his fierce competitiveness to win all puck battles, but still need improvement  in the way of handling and carrying the puck. Committed to Cornell."
99,2013,Juuse Saros,"Smaller, stocky goaltender playing in the U-20 of Finland with considerable success. Years away from consideration as a possible pro goaltender, but shows excellent skills and upside. He was selected to the roster for the World Junior Under-18 Tournament in April and showed off his lightning quick reflexes, but the fact that he is undersized may see teams passing on him altogether."
103,2013,Justin Auger,Huge third year eligible winger with straight-line quickness and the power to set up in front. A work in progress.
104,2013,Andrew Coop,Second year eligible forward who many felt have football as his first choice. A great athlete and good skater who has worked his way up the University of Michagn roster to to six status.  He has much to learn but has shown some offensive ability to go with decent defensive abilty and hard work.
100,2013,Miles Wood,Lunch pail winger with excellent speed and compete.
97,2013,Michael Downing,"Big defender that is coming into his own. Shows physicality, a quick stick, long reach, mobility, and skill. Displays excellent reach, and poise when he has the puck, and passes very well up ice. Is not a polished up ice guy or on the PP, but shows potential to develop into a strong defensive defenseman who will control areas with his stick and physicality. His defensive game is a work in progress, his transition game will only get better. Tremendous upside. Committed to the University of Michigan."
95,2013,Felix Girard,"Tough under-6-footer who plays a hard-nosed game for 60 minutes. He is an energy player who has some skill, good feet, and lots of sandpaper. He was named to the Hockey Canada's National Men's Summer Under-18 Team selection camp that will compete at the 2011 Ivan Hlinka Memorial Tournament."
94,2013,Jackson Houck,"Hard working two way wing with a combination of physical edge and offensive prowess. Not the most polished skater at this point, but a punishing checker, quintescentail team player who can get the puck to the open man, and even chip in a big goal. Scored 23 goals and 57 points on a rebuilding Giants club that only won 21 games."
96,2013,Kyle Platzer,"Playing for a strong London club, he was buried on the lower lines with less chances to develop this last season. Some team may like what they see and select him with the hopes he can develop inot a strong two-way power wing down the road."
90,2013,Peter Cehlarik,"One of the younger players in the Swedish Elitserien, he has a high skill level and excellent wheels for a big man, with a quick release. Has a powerful stride and excellent balance. Not fast but quick, with soft hands and some dangle. Protects the puck well and has good instincts. He has a high long term upside as he develops playing against older and better players. He was selected to the roster for the World Junior Under-18 Tournament in April."
92,2013,Evan Cowley,"Another NAHL goaltender with great size and and emerging abilities. Since goaltenders traditionally are brought along slowly, he is on the radar as a long term developmental player."
89,2013,Oliver Bjorkstrand,"Opportunistic Danish import who displays quick hands and is always around the puck. His father Todd, played pro hockey in North America. Helps create chances with smart movement and strong, persistent forechecking. Top rookie scorer in the WHL. Knows how to attack, with very good stickhandling ability and soft hands. Not big, not fast, just makes plays. Unafraid to get dirty and throw hits. A member of his homeland’s team roster for the World Junior Under-20 at Christmas 2014."
86,2013,Sven Andrighetto,"2nd year eligible diminutive wing who is very skilled and will get consideration in the late rounds. Displays offensive tools in a compact size, and made every NHL team take notice with his play in the QMJHL playoffs. He QBs the pp from the point with a wiked one-timer.  Seems strong and durable enough to get consideration as  prospect who can advance into some level of the pro ranks."
85,2013,Cole Cassels,"The son of former NHLer Andrew is good face-off man with an excellent compete level nice speed, and good hands. Plays hard and his heavy shot sees time on the PP. Plays on a talent-laden club, but has not emerged as the cream of that crop, with minimual numbers and appears to be good at all phases, but doesn't stand in any of them at this juncture."
83,2013,Bogdan Yakimov,"Huge big-framed centre with good jump and excellent lateral movement. Excellent passionate competitor who can control the wall. Plays strong on the puck, and can look for the open man if he gets free, but likes to take the shot over trying to draw things to him and passing it off.  Is a load to move from the front once he bulls his way in and plants. Big heavy shot and quick release. May be an up and comer if his upward progression continues, and he gets better handling the puck on the move, and improves his skating."
93,2013,Mason Geertsen,"Projects as a defensive shutdown guy who is solid on his feet and a punishing checker, and open-ice hitter who closes the gaps in junior with excellent success. The added bonus is he is ready and willing fighter who will drop'em and give most combatants a handful."
88,2013,Anton Slepyshev,"Undrafted last year primarily due to the ""Russian factor."" He is an agile wing who shows exceptional offensive abilities and leads his team by his play. Already a strong two-way player. played on wing of Russia's top World Junior line. Not a player who woes you with extraordinary ability in one phase. He is simply good at all phases, and both PP and PK are strengths. Smart when carrying puck and will only get better as he fills out and gains strength. He has two years left on his deal in Russia so the team selecting him will wait two seasons before even getting him over the pond to adapt his play to the North American game."
87,2013,Keaton Thompson,"Joined Fargo as a 15 year old. Excellent all-around reliable defenseman with size, skill and some snarl.  Shows the makings of good all-around defenseman, due to his natural poise and balance, and all-around skating ability. Excellent competitor who can handle all situations, with poise and calm. Passes the puck really well. The team that drafts him knows from the get-go that his understanding and poise and abilities, with no long-term development to fix areas of concern. He was selected to the roster for the World Junior Under-18 Tournament in April."
82,2013,Carter Verhaege,"Raw but developing long term prospect who plays centre but may also project as a wing.  His skating has a hitch in it but I wouldn't say he cannot improve the stride. He does have a good burst and very good control of the biscuit when on the move. He is good in the dot. He sees and reads the offenisve zone. Handles the defensive zone well. Good hands in terms of stickhandling, but seems to have a poor release and never be a scorer. He nonetheless is an intriguing guy teams may look to as a guy farther down the road, as he clearly can play most phases well in junior. He was selected to the roster for the World Junior Under-18 Tournament in April."
84,2013,Jimmy Lodge,"Big skilled wing who is still growing into his body. He is very thin, but has plenty of room for added muscle and girth. A smart on-ice player who lines up at left wing, but also likes to attack from the right circle in. Long term pick who has considerable upside, due to his speed, quickness, scoring ability, soft hands and good vision. He has long term potential to round out as a gritty player with a developing skills package."
91,2013,J.C. Lipon,"Speedy Western league centre-wing who has blossomed with additional ice-time. The third year eligible has been a leading scorer / playmaker all season in the ""Dub"" and part of Canada's World Junior Tourney team."
78,2013,Marcus Högberg,"Plays big and does take up lots of space. Strong mechanics and calm under fire, he moves well in the butterfly and has a very good low game with quick pads, while still using his shoulders to close the top of the net."
75,2013,Pavel Buchnevich,"Stood out in international competitions with his high skill level. Creative player who is fearless in all parts of the offensive zone. A smooth skater who is deceptively quick with his soft hands which allow him to get loose and/or set up linemates. Fearless in traffic and is great in one-on-one.  A strong forechecker. The way he beats you is by coming out of a pack with the puck and using his lightning release to wrist it into the net before defensive players can react. As with all the Russian-based prospects, their final draft slottings are entirely tied to whether or not they are committed to crossing the pond and actually attempting to become NHLers. He was selected to the roster for the World Junior Under-18 Tournament in April."
80,2013,Anthony Duclair,"A year ago scored at a point-per-game pace and hasn't slowed much, with 50 points in 55 games this season. Great speed and dangle. Possesses great vision and is an offensive generator. Top-end elusiveness and puck skills. Can go wide on a defender and cut to the front. Needs to build strength and aggressiveness, but does surpirse with some heavy checks. Once thought of as a sure bet first round selection, his development didn't keep keep pace with the strong draft crop. He should start reaching those expectations with more minutes next season. Possesses plenty of skill and traits for a team select him and watch him develop as a scorer as well as a generator."
74,2013,John Hayden,"Big-framed centre-wing who plays hard and tough along the wall and in the front. Has a willingness ot block shots and do what he has to to make life difficult for the opposition. He is working on improvng his feet. Crashes the front of the net and causes significant commotion to the defenseman while doing so. Some might question just how much offensive upside he has, but further development may yield a polished and difficult to play against offensive player too. He was selected to the roster for the World Junior Under-18 Tournament in April."
73,2013,Ryan Kujawinski,"Big centre who skates well and leads the rush. He has quickness and good skills. Can use his wheels or out-finesse defenders when in the attack zone. Seems at his best when he plays like the big man that he is with a bit of nasty. Good hockey sense. Is effective defensively and on offensive, he is terrific when forcing the issue down low. Handles the puck very well and is a good set-up man. He may end up on wing, as he is less set-up man and more shoot first guy, where he displays a lightning fast wrist shot. His offensive production this season will have strong bearing on where he ends up being selected, as he only lit the lamp 17 times."
76,2013,Taylor Cammarata,Fearless smaller wing who is sturdy and quick. Committed to the University of Minnesota.
70,2013,Eamon McAdam,American born 'tender who will at the end of this season have three seasons in the USHL under his belt. Tall and thin. Handles the puck like a forward.  Committed to Penn State.
72,2013,Tyrell Goulbourne,"Under six foot team player who skates very well and gives maximum effort each time he steps on the sheet. Leads by example with hard work for all 200 feet and puts it all out there. A griity player who will block shots, take hits, and do anything to help his team win."
68,2013,Niklas Hansson,"Possible sleeper who plays in the Swedish Elite league has many of the qualities that the NHL has found in past selections from Sweden, except he isn't a towering presence, or at this point, a solid defender. What he does bring is an excellent all-around skill set, great wheels, and strong up-ice vison and instincts. Teams may look at him as a guy they select with the thought that his all around defensive game rounds out. Gamble or not, there is a pretty good chance he gets chosen at some point."
69,2013,Nick Baptiste,Big wing who moves well and plays strong down low and on the wall. Very good speed and quickness for a big man and great upside for this once high-scoring midget player. Uses his body and is above average speed in battles for the puck. Kills penalties. Is willing to take the hit to make the play. Displays a very good release with his shot.  He was selected to the roster for the World Junior Under-18 Tournament in April.
77,2013,Jake Guentzel,"Diminutive centre who has a high hockey IQ and feel for the play.  Has always managed to be an offensive threat at each level, due to his tremendous laterally quickness, and edging. Strong snap shot that he lets go at a moment's notice. Strong forechecker who drives possession. Displays good defensive committment. Must get stronger but will probably merit consideration due to his scoring ability."
64,2013,Jonathan Ismael Diaby,Huge youngster who is always willing to come to the aid of his teammates. Lanky defender is far from the finished product and will need time and patience as he develops. Possesses a heavy shot. Skates well for a big man and is slowing improving at his position.  His size has aid in him being view as a good puck shielder. A long term gamble that will need lots of time and work to ever play in the big leagues.
62,2013,Yan-Pavel Laplante,"Thick centreman whose gifts of girth, wheels, and skill project him as an aggressive power player at a future date. Plays in traffic and is unafraid of setting up in front. Is quick enough to beat junior defenders one on one. Plays like a grinder with a high compete level, and is good on the forecheck. An effective wall player. His junior team, P.E.I., often asks him to shoulder the load. On the radar as a power forward prospect, because he finishes checks, goes and back-checks on dee, and is plenty shifty when he has the puck.  He was selected to the roster for the World Junior Under-18 Tournament in April."
67,2013,Keegan Kanzig,"Projects as a big physical defenseman who takes care of business in his end, seeing plenty of minutes against the top opposition lines and on the PK. Skates well and closes gaps and clogs lanes with his stick. He doesn't display an advanced offensive side or do too much puck carrying, but plays to his strength with success. Plays with and edge, and doesn't lose fights. A bit more quickness will only improve his ablity to play his style."
66,2013,Brett Pesce,"Tall lanky defenseman with 4-way skating ability and very good offensive tools and hockey sense. A mature all around defender who has offensive upside. Excellent outlet passer, and defensively closes quickly and has an active stick. Distributes the puck well with good vision and patience as the PP pointman. Not shy of contact. Superb at controlling gaps and has an air of calmness to the way he plays his position. He is still not hefty enough to engage many bigger forwards, but he is great at taking the angles on them."
65,2013,Adam Tambellini,"All-around quality prospect with good feet, a great shot, and all-around game. Is growing bigger and stronger. He plays strong on the puck, and in the battle areas and never takes a shift off. Creates space and finds his way to the open spots. Has really good reach and projects as a wing if centre doesn't work out. Still needs time and hasn't played with top competition, but displays many fine characteristics that project him as an excellent developmental wing prospect down the road."
63,2013,Spencer Martin,"Bigger goaler with upside who saw nine games as back-up in Mississauga, and has assumed a starting role. Sound positionally, excellent reflexes, and glove. Has showed strong play on a team that isn't an elite one. Has excellent anticipation and lightning fast quickness, good rebound control, and has displayed elite level prospect skills and a bright developmental future.   He was selected to the roster for the World Junior Under-18 Tournament in April."
59,2013,Eric Comrie,"Developing goaler with strong glove, good lateral movement, and quick feet. Was a key component in Canada's Ivan Hlinka Tournament win. Has been a workhorse for his team and has shown great tools while advancing his game skyward. Rising talent who most assurdedly will be drafted early in June."
56,2013,Marc-Olivier Roy,"Wasn't a prolific scorer, but this season he surpassed last years goal totals by early November,and continued on with 67 points in 65 games. A full game motor like the energizer bunny. He possesses excellent speed, and plays in all situations. HAs some physicality to his game. He has a larger frame that could fill out even more. Has good size, strong motor, and a good hockey IQ."
58,2013,Tyler Bertuzzi,"Undersized, but very feisty wing who is a relentless buzzbomb shift after shift, makinguncle Todd proud. Plays in the battle zones, and dirty areas like he was a foot taller, and is sandpaper to the opposition. Overly aggressive, chippy and looking to battle."
55,2013,Artturi Lehkonen,"Under six footer with good speed, hands, and high-end passing ability. At the Ivan Hlinka tourney, he was the second best scorer. Great on-ice vision and skill set. Is simply a player that is opportunistic,always in the right spot and able to use his quick release to finish. Is one of thiose players that has that feel and advance sight, so he can distribute the puck to the right teammate or get to the open spot to receive it. The question is how well he fares against bigger stronger opposition. He was selected to the roster for the World Junior Under-18 Tournament in April."
57,2013,William Carrier,"The physical left winger had a strong 70 point season in 2011-12 and a good playoff. Solid frame,quickness, and big heavy shot. Projects as a bottom end player with scoring ability and upside. Was hampered by a ankle sprain for a significant portion of the schedule. It was easy to see how impacted the way scouts saw his skating ability, but he is a North-South player on a bad team, whose skating HAS improved a lot. Really strong on the puck, and his skates, with good hands and passing ability. He sees the ice well, and can throw a really hard it too."
61,2013,Zach Sanford,"Large wing  who has size, strength, a hockey head and outstanding hands at the Division One level. Good playmaker who moves well. Is an above average passer, and has a good backhander, and can play the game with puck while moving at his top speed. Good on his skates and has a strong stride, and also as good a short touch passer as you will see.  If he chooses to play more physically, there is huge upside in this large package."
60,2013,Linus Arnesson,"Big skilled Swede defender already playing in the Super-elite league. Tremedous upside based on toughness skill, smarts and feet. Maintains gaps as his four-way skating abilty let's him close down quickly. Up ice you won't see him going lateral but concentrating on straight ahead and head manning the puck. Sees the ice well, plays mistake-free, and is an excellent touch passer. Solid two way defender who thinks defense first and despite limited offensive upside and little snarl to his defensive game is an excellent prospect."
42,2013,Steve Santini,"Potential shut-down defender who takes care of his end with an edge. He is big, strong and effective. Possesses a physical demeanor that he uses to stop the opposition. Not afraid to drop'em. Has a hard point shot, and also is very good as a point passer. A smart player who reads and passes the puck well. A horse who plays big minutes and has untapped offensive potential. His work on defense is stand-up. He closes gaps and stands up many an attacker with checks. He was selected to the roster for the World Junior Under-18 Tournament in April. (Committed to Boston College.)"
41,2013,Robert Hägg,"Big sturdy D-man with significant upside on both sides of his game. Is a quick-stick player who loves to turn it up-ice and go. Plays with calm and confidence, especially when on the point, setting up the attack. Shows good quickness straight ahead, but needs better lateral agility, footwork,and gap closure. Projects as a second pairing NHL defender with ruggedness and good passing skill. He needs to handle the outside rushes and improve his gap control, as the faster NHL players will be a challenge, if he doesn't. His PP cannon shot seems to have a mind of it's own. He could end up a big punishing-type defender, and there is plenty of upside for him to pass that watermark. He was selected to the roster for the World Junior Under-18 Tournament in April."
53,2013,Madison Bowey,"High quality puck-carrier who is an all compass fleet power-skating attacker who distributes the puck well or just leads the attack. Out of the Kelowna system known for developing all-around smart defenders, he will be on all the scout's radar as the 2012-13 season goes on. Shows good gap control and handles his own end well. Strong & reliable defensively, and likes the physical aspects of his position. Will eventually improve his skills as a point man and PP QB. He was selected to the roster for the World Junior Under-18 Tournament in April and scored an in the crease goal in the Championship game."
54,2013,Philippe Desrosiers,"Athletic netminder who took ove rthe chores with the Oceanic as the number one goalie. He is a developing player who has improved in terms of his overall technique, and play. A long term  prospect who has improved his rebound control and over-all game.   He was selected to the roster for the World Junior Under-18 Tournament in April."
43,2013,Nic Petan,"Highly competitive little man with excellent acceleration and a really heavy shot. Can go wide on defenseman and battles for the puck and drives the net.  Backchecks, and attacks with the same quickness. His 120 points (including 74 assists) in 71 games tied him for the regular season scoring crown alongside linemate Brendan Leipsic, and 28 points in 21 games through the WHL playoffs. Teams will think hard if he is on the board, because he may be a Jordan Eberle clone. Explodes in transition, and soft hands and great skill. He will work to gain strength and get his weight to 175."
38,2013,Conner Hurley,"Youngest player in the draft as his birthday is the cut-off mark. He is a good two-way centre with surprising speed, good vision and a strong work ethic, and tempered physicalty. Strong on the puck and ellusive on the run, he is a smart and creative centre who has a quick shot to go with the quick motor.  Excellent agility, lightning jump and a fluid strong stride get him wherever he wants to be. Needs to get stronger."
37,2013,Valentin Zykov,"QMJHL transplant who look exceptional on the Russian Team in the Subway Series in November. Creative player who is scoring with regularity, he has entrenched himself into the Entry draft's  third tier of prospects. Projects as a wide body who has strong scoring ability.  Plays with grit and strong on the puck, and stranger is no to the corners.Was named the CHL rookie of the year. He has decent hands and he clicked and produced with his Drakkar linemates after a very ordinary career in Russia, might point to him being a better North American style player. The very fact he came over to adjust to the smaller North American rinks has NHL teams viewing him as a player who wants to be a future NHLer and not return to Russian before he has."
39,2013,Laurent Dauphin,"While a member of Phénix du Collège Esther-Blondin, was named the MVP of the Telus Cup, the Canadian national midget championship. Put his name into the conversation with a strong two goal prospects game. He plays on both the PP & PK, and wants the puck on his stick. Still very thin, he will need strength and weight training to continue to play past the junior level. He has excellent hands and instincts. He goes to the net extremely well. He was selected to the roster for the World Junior Under-18 Tournament in April."
35,2013,J.T. Compher,"Warrior with good speed, decent size, and fearlessness in battle areas. Positions himself well when his team is without the puck. Strong on his skates and very mobile. Excellent face-off man with a strong quick release on his shot. Throws the opposition off with his tenacity and infectious edge. Hockey sense plus scoring ability and relentless two-way commitment. A center who distributes the puck exceptionally well and shoots it well. Very strong and has good upside to grow an offensive game. Strong on his skates and a good diagnostician while moving with speed on the attack. He added quickness to his stride but can get quicker. He was selected to the roster for the World Junior Under-18 Tournament in April, and was arguably the best player in the US win in the semis. (Committed to the University of Michigan)"
40,2013,Remi Elie,"Quick physical wing who is a good developmental project at forward. In the OHL playoffs, he came through with goals and assists that may have lifted his upside, but nevertheless, has lots to learn about pace and coverage. Plays with a passion, but sometimes the lack of pace has him running around and then gassed. He displays some scoring prowess too. Will see more ice next year, and with it there are big hopes he develops further."
36,2013,Zack Fucale,"Top goalie prospect in North America at this juncture. Last season he lead his team in the first round of the QMJHL playoffs with four wins and an under 2.00 GAA, until the talent-laden Remparts lit him up. This season he has lost very few games. Displays good lateral mobility, and strong techincal skills. Cool, calm competitor with an aggressive style who stand tall and square up well, and has good fluidity."
33,2013,Adam Erne,"Strong, balanced skater who shows outside speed and an excellent shot. Plays a mix of a power-forward and sniper. Plays with power on the wall and wins puck battles there. The lightning release of his shot and his ability to find space make him much to contend with. Plays fearlessly and hungry, creates space, is a playmaker, and shoots extremely well. Reads, sets, and attacks well with a dominating presence. Throws big checks. Powerful shot. Will improve his abilities to handle the loose pucks by planting in the crease.  He can line up at any of the three forward positions and not look out of place. Has NHLer written all over him."
32,2013,Chris Bigras,"Smart six foot offenseman who is able to lead, QB and dominate on his team's PP. He doesn't make many mistakes, playing his position very disciplined. A solid all around defender in junior. He has excellent upside as a prospect due to his hockey IQ, and smart decision making, but I just don't see him as first rounder or player NHL teams select with their first choice, as he is a 'tweener"" and past history has seen guys close in comparison be devalued because teams are weary as to whether they can grow and develop into the pro game. He was selected to the roster for the World Junior Under-18 Tournament in April."
29,2013,Jason Dickinson,"Excellent long-term prospect who is an excellent stickhandler and skater with offensive skills. he has a deceptive skating stride and can lull defenders and then by-pass them. Goes to the net.  A strong shot-blocking penalty-killer. Needs to get stronger to be a thicker player and a more powerful shooter. Has that instinctive ability to score and make things happen. Can pass the puck extremely well. Has show high end ability but only in spurts, and lacks complete game constistency and pop. Needs strength and more girth. He was selected to the roster for the World Junior Under-18 Tournament in April."
30,2013,Ryan Hartman,"Led the USA-NTP U-17 team in scoring last season. A physical-style player who already understands the nuances of both offensive and defensive coverages, and leads by example. He shows plenty of promise to climb up the scouting lists, because he plays an ultra aggressive style fits NHL playoff style hockey, despite being under six foot. He pressures the opposition in plenty of ways, including those they don't like. Extremely smart and reads the on-ice situations, and will know when to drive the front, when to shoot, and the spot where to get open. Despite descriptions by many as not fast and under-sized, he has exceptional small area quickness in stop and starts and is a strong penalty killer. He can slide back to centre ice if needed, and can play all three forward positions with grit, nasty and enough sandpaper that he can a disruptive force in all three zones."
26,2013,Shea Theodore,"Strong skating defender with a strong offensive game. Reads the ice well and is a good passer. His all-compass agility allows him time in all zones. Power play pointman with accurate shot. He will need time to develop physically, but it looks like there will be significant payoff down the road. A work in progress, in terms of reacting to quick game decison-making and reacting.  He was selected to the roster for the World Junior Under-18 Tournament in April."
34,2013,Jacob de la Rose,"Agile three zone centre-forward with speed, impressive puck skills, who plays an aggressive forechecking game, as well as having a strong offensive side. he is a North-South skater who shoots, hits and and finds rebounds and has a solid 200 foot game. Possesses excellent functional strength, good feet and straight ahead acceleration. Handles the bisquit well at top speed, and distributes well. Finishes checks and uses his size in the cycle down low. Aggressively involves himself, as his size may call for him to play with more edge than finesse, but is a dependable positionally sound defensive player who gets asked to shut down the opponents late and on the penalty kill. He is a solid body checker too.  Intriguing long term potential as a power wing with size, offensive upside, and solid two way impact. He was selected to the roster for the World Junior Under-18 Tournament in April."
31,2013,Ian McCoshen,"Big skilled two-way defender who  committed to Boston College. Plays to his size with strong physicality in the front and on the wall. Has good functional strength and can handle physical attackers. Skates well and has good skill when he has the puck. Has the potential and demeanor to continue to work hard to be an extremely talented player. Doesn't get ruffled in the defensive zone and stays cool with his puck decisions back there. If he develops a bit more edge, he could have a nice future."
28,2013,Morgan Klimchuk,"Sniper, pure and simple. A hard working, superb handed, opportunistic goal scorer that can provide game-changing passes and goals at any moment.  To be an NHL sniper he needs more strength, but he has an elite level ""catch and release"" shot that happens at top level speed. Still under six foot and room for muscle, but still showed he was an elite junior player at the 2012 World U-17’s, scoring 2 goals and 6 points in 5 games for Team Pacific. More of an North-South skater who is good at finding the places to attack and makes scoring chances for himself and linemates with his excellent passing.  He was selected to the roster for the World Junior Under-18 Tournament in April, where he played mostly on the wing."
27,2013,Marko Dano,"Smart stocky centre with good hockey IQ, playmaking and finishing ability. Strong and balanced on his skates, but not the quickest jump from the get-go. Is great in close and the battle areas, because when carrying, he is quite elusive. Plays a robust physical style. Scored twice in the Canada-Slovak game in the World Juniors at Christmas."
23,2013,Andre' Burakowsky,"Tall, slender Swedish RW/LW with good hands and presence in the crease area. May be top end offensive skill. Has a burst to beat defenders outside, has ability to get open in the attack, and quickly releases his shot. Very agile and can play to the speed of his feet. Soft hands and shot, but sometimes hogs the puck because of his faith in his own ability to score and doesn't distribute when he probably should. Excellent one-timer and instinctive offensive abilities. Although not overly physical, plays in the dirty areas and withstands the pounding. Protects the puck well, and willing to get dirty to keep it. Could be an explosive pro wing, whose acceleration makes him a threat with each touch of the puck.He was selected to the roster for the World Junior Under-18 Tournament in April."
22,2013,Emile Poirier,"200 foot scoring wing was late birthday who displays good feet. excellent vision, good puck shielding skills, and quick hands. He has battled through many injuries and hasn't shown that offensive upside to the extent that he is capable. Really excellent instincts and superbs hands and wrister. A power player who never stops working, with commitment and smart play everywhere. Plays tough. The only area he needs work in is on one on one battles, but he is instinctive in most phases of the game. Some might cap his offensive upside, but I see an NHL power player in the making."
21,2013,Frédérik Gauthier,"The big center was going to be counted on for his defensive prowess and size, but has shown surprising offensive abilities early on in his rookie campaign with the ""Q."" He needs work in the face-off circle, with his footwork and sustainin physicality, but his scoring ability and the projected potential in all other areas has to get him first round consideration early on. He was selected to the roster for the World Junior Under-18 Tournament in April. He has been one of the big surprises in the QMJHL. The questions NHL teams will ask is he really a second line big centre who will play big, and pot some goals."
20,2013,Anthony Mantha,"Tall left winger with physicality and scoring prowess, as well as willingness to stick up for his teammates. A physical presence in the Q that has elevated himself into the first round by playing well in each outing. He missed the cut-off to the 2012 draft by one-day, and in 2011-12 has a respectable 22 goals and 51 points in the QMJHL. Increased that to reach the 50 goal  plateau this season. He does come with a little concern that he can play uninvolved and unwilling to do much of the dirty work on the back check to unearth pucks. No one wants to start placing labels on junior scorer who come off lacking enthusiasm and full game commitment, but you have to wonder if it leads to his fall down the slottings."
19,2013,Kerby Rychel,"Warren Rychel's son is as tough as nails, a ready and willing combatant, and a grit player. He has good hands for a guy whose bread & butter is down low, where his tenacious forecheck can disrupt and cause havoc in the cycle. His skating needs work, but he moves with agility and strength, and poses problems on every shift with his physicality, playmaking abilities, and puck control. Plays in every situation and even takes the odd face-off. He scored 41 goals in 2011-12, and no matter how you break down his lack of elite skills, or his average size, he is a player that just scores with hard work."
24,2013,Hunter Shinkaruk,"Established himself as a scorer in the ""Dub"" early on with excellent vision, hockey smarts, and skill. The upper-echelon wheels, stick-handling, and ability to find the soft spots in open ice, override his current stature and frame. Very strong on his skates, always able to come back and help in his zone, and has excellent offensive instincts. Had great hands and makes plays in tight. Scored over 40 goals in 2011-12. Plays with a whole bit of nasty, and fills the agitator's role, game in and game out, despite not being a physical force. An intense Stan Mikita-type presence that is bringing it with scoring and bite on a consistent basis."
16,2013,Nikita Zadorov,"Four-direction skater with all-around abilities to excel as a pro. Powerfully strong prospect wth great size, wheels, balance, and burst. Plays tough and is a player that gets noticed by the opposition because he goes after them. Uses his balance and natural talent to get in strong hits all over the ice and still maintains position and keeps focused on the game. Plays nasty, and can beat you on O or D. The ""Russian factor"" had him pushed back in the rankings, but his arrival in North America will most certainly gain him strong first round consideration. You don't get a strong two-way defenseman from the outset, but you do get a big physical one who will engage attackers with regularity. There certainly is time for growth of an offensive game, as long as he chooses to stick around North America and develop one."
15,2013,Ryan Pulock,"Has the size, tools and skill to be considered an early pick. Was strictly a forward until midget hockey, so there is a bit more polishing needed, but is a superb stickhandler, passer, shooter, skater and physical player. Quick snapper, booming slapper and quick passer who clears the front of his crease too. Viewed as an all-offense defenseman, due to his skating, puck-carrying and heavy shot, he will grow into a well-rounded defender based on his abilities, vision and hockey smarts. Given time, he may be a true impact player."
25,2013,Michael McCarron,"Defensive minded forward with great size, jump, and punch. An intense physical competitor who leaves an impression so you know you have played against him. Very good straight-liner balanced skater who must tighten his pivots so he can turn with play. Good vision. Does an exceptional job of winning pucks but needs to improve his tight quarters work and become stronger on the puck when carrying. Displays very good effort without the puck with his reach, and back-checks hard. This is a big bodied North-South forward with very good skill set, and can play downright nasty and well. He is getting co-ordinated with his growing body, he has to be viewed as long-term pick with significant upside. Nonetheless, he seems to be rocketing up the draft boards. Committed to Michigan. He was selected to the roster for the World Junior Under-18 Tournament in April."
14,2013,Alexander Wennberg,"Prototypical Swedish forward who plays strong all-around and steps his game up when the play ratchets up. Can play all three forward positions, and his experience as a centre has made him an extremely well schooled defensive player.  Is good on the tip-in, and he will be in the high traffic areas looking for them and rebounds. He has great hands and instincts to go with them. Excellent backhand passer. Have an excellent feel for how things develop in the attack zone. Simply a very good offensive zone passer whose work brings chances. He plays like he is bigger than his stature, beating defenders and getting to the opening space."
17,2013,Curtis Lazar,"Skilled physical center who combines good playmaking skills and an accurate shot with grit. Reliable face-off man, relentless forechecker. A big-bodied player who sticks his nose in and can carry a significant amount of the on-ice load. Strong on his skates and good with his stick in traffic. Creates scoring chances with his quickness by forcing turnovers, and heavy pressure. Well rounded and smart on every part of the pond. Scored 30 goals as 16 year old in 2011-12, and will probably score at least that many this season.  He possesses a quick release and very hard shot. Stats do not tell the full story on him, and his character and upside are such that he will be a total team player who might just surprise you when he starts lighting the lamp."
10,2013,Valery Nichushkin,"6'3"" Valery is a physically dominant sniper who has excelled at every level he has played in.  He once broke the record in the Ural-Western Siberia region with 87 goals and 127 points in just over 30 games. Spents much of the early part of the season in the VHL, finished the year playing in the Russian SuperLeague. He shows considerable talent and upside. His size and ability to play center or power forward combined with his shot and power skating make him a big man with the mobility of one much smaller. He simply flies! He has the ability to make room and open the ice for his team with his scoring chances and set-ups. Can barrel by defenders from the outside and power push them out of his way as he cuts for the front.  Still more of a one-man show that wants to attack and shoot, and doesn't look for teammates/options while on the attack. Left a strong impression of his abilities in the Subway Super series in early November. Then showed an encore of his skills at the World Junior.  If play-making skills develop, he could end up a top pick. He was selected to the roster for the World Junior Under-18 Tournament in April, and although he didn't make the impact he did in the Subway Series, it might be due to him him finishing up a 25 game playoff run with Traktor Chelyabinsk in the KHL. The fact that he has announced that Dynamo Moskva has agreed to terminate the dal he had signed to play there next season, and that he is coming over to play in  North America. Reportedly Dynamo paid 10 million rubles to secure his rights. If that report is accurate, it seems very unlikely that Dynamo would agree to his departure without a fuss. If it is a certainty that he coming across the pond, it might radically change the order in the top four slottings. Stay tuned, because if he arrives in the Fall, he plays in the NHL in the Fall."
12,2013,Max Domi,"Potential impact player whose bloodlines and current course of play exhibit a gritty bulldozer with great vision, speed, and skill. His lower center of gravity, excellent playmaking agility, and all-around game smarts, project him as a scorer and all-around leader in all phases of the game. Shoots a heavy puck, passes tape to tape, and is a load for a smaller package. May not be a big orelite skater, but he still is very fast and robust when necessary. I understand how guys without height are under lots of scrutiny, but Domi by no means has a disadvantage at his height as he is thick, smart and strong."
13,2013,Josh Morrissey,"Plays an extremely mature two-way game, but you can't leave without feeling he has top-level offensive abilities, due to his skating, elite skill, and puck-moving strengths. Already pretty sound defensively and has a big cannon on the PP right point with his left hand shot. Confident and smooth, he can lead the rush, or quickly close down and stop the ememy's attempt at one. At this point not overly large, but gets the job done. Controls gaps and will step up physically to stop the advance. Clearly one of the top  defenders in North America, but will need polish to advance. He was selected to the roster for the World Junior Under-18 Tournament in April."
18,2013,Mirco Müller,"Swiss defender with all around the rink smarts. Diagnoses the situation and reacts accordingly. Good puck carrier who can go up ice quickly or slow the game down. Closes down on attackers and is a good hitter. Turns quickly and is very good with the  transition pass up ice. Just starting to scratch the surface of his potential. Player rising on the radar. He displays strong glimpses of all the things you desire in an NHL defenseman. You may not look at him as a top pairing guy, just an NHL defenseman who fits and plays and improves.He was selected to the roster for the World Junior Under-18 Tournament in April. A member of his homeland’s team roster for the World Junior Under-20 at Christmas 2014."
8,2013,Rasmus Ristolainen,"Was already a presence on D at the 2011-12 World Juniors, where he was the right point-man on the number one power play, and was asked to step up and fill in at a spot usual occupied by the older junior defenseman. He is big, physical and skilled, and has a low-panic level and shoots the puck hard and fast. He is very mobile and agile as an attacker and power-play pointman. He already plays in a league with grown men and successfully competes. Gets used on both points on the power play. You may not be getting an elite up-ice guy, but more of a highly capable two-way guy who will surprise you when he jumps up into the attack. One of the top defensive prospects of this class and clearly one of the bigger bodies."
6,2013,Sean Monahan,"Impressive big man with good speed and all-compass mobility, and equally impressive offensive instincts. Will fill out to be an even larger pro, he has a nice first step and ability to control play down low and along the boards. A fine scorer with a quick release, he could play in phone booth with success, as he stick handles and moves as well as any smaller skilled forward, but can still beat teams with his power game. He surpassed his rookie point totals in the the first 30 games and looks to be an impressive pro.  He choose to be part of a club which was in a rebuilding mode, and has had to shoulder lots of the weight. Doesn't have the all-out flash and dash of the other early picks, but is an excellent smart player with significant positives and upside. Could go higher than expected."
11,2013,Samuel Morin,"Tall lanky defender who moves well for a big man and shows agility and skills to project him as possible NHLer if he continues to work hard and improve his game at the current upward rate. Uses his size to his advantage. Needs work on footwork, mobility,and pivots, because at this point, he cannot play to the speed of the game. Makes clean outlet passes and has good up-ice carries. He was selected to the roster for the World Junior Under-18 Tournament in April."
7,2013,Darnell Nurse,"Big, mobile defenseman who is a bit of a long-term project, but displays an emerging physically punishing game. An exceptional PK defender with quick starts/stops and a quick stick. Father played pro football. Donavan McNabb is married to his aunt. Very fluid skater with fine range, and displays playmaking abilities. Still needs to build his defensive game and edge. Reads situations well and can pass the puck tape to tape. Can throw punishing hits and use his reach. At this juncture, he plays it safe, and doesn't go out of his way to jump into the attack. There is excellent upside because he shows strong instincts in all three zones, has a good stick, and can dish while his wheels are churning. His improved up-ice work as puck carrier and passer has elevated him as a first rounder, and there is still time for him to build his offensive game. I don't think that aspect will drop him very far down the NHL team lists."
3,2013,Jonathan Drouin,"Undersized play-making left winger with excellent skill and hockey smarts. Displays top offensive abilities at the junior level due to his vision and feel for the play and where to be. Elusive one-on-one and an excellent passer. Fearless. Goes to the front. Needs additional core strength, but anyone who tries to dismiss his abilities as an elite stand-alone junior player is not looking at how dominant he can be in so many facets. I don't know how high his NHL ceiling is, but he certainly could be a special player down the road. He already possesses top-notch speed, a separation gear, and elusiveness."
5,2013,Elias Lindholm,"Another prototypical Swedish forward with excellent NHL upside. Has good wheels, tremendous quickness, a quick stick, and plays strong on the puck with overall game toughness. Could be a special player down the road. At this point more of a playmaker, but his recent showings have displayed a really smart offensive threat who can withstand the rough going, while maintaining his more finesse style of play. Currently playing wing, but can play pivot too."
1,2013,Nathan MacKinnon,"Dominant player with outstanding vision and natural scoring ability. He still needs to get stronger, but already displays elite scoring instincts. Big time shot that comes in hard and heavy. Great feet and balance and moves effortlessly to open space and in traffic always diagnosing the best place to go with the biscuit. He is more of a straight-line skater and that might hamper mega-success as a pro centre. Though not really big, he is fearless and physical in his desire to set up scoring opportunities. Aggressive player who is a natural scorer and a pretty good set-up man. Saw time on RW in Subway Series and may end up playing there in the World Juniors. Has scored five goals in game. I don't mean to disrespect a truly great young player, who in most years, would hands down be in consideration for the top selection, but the question remains: if a team feels he just doesn't seem to have that inert feel for setting up the attack and more like he is that scorer who can be a weapon from the wing, teams may look elsewhere if they want a true centreman. Combines high hockey IQ with a strong skating base, toughness, puck skills, and quick-counter abilities to out-match most opponents."
9,2013,Bo Horvat,"Center-forward on the powerhouse London Knights who has seen time on the wing, and is an exceptional face-off man. Exceptionally strong and effective three-zone stud who is a rock of a specimen. Strong on the puck and in the cycle, as well as coming out to the front with the puck for the shot. Good shot and good passer, he projects as an almost certain selection with upside. As a rookie last year he was on the PK team, and stood out as part of Team Ontario at the 2012 U17 WHC’s, with 4 goals and 7 points in 6 games. Was named the MVP of the OHL playoffs. When the puck is on his stick, you can be sure he either penetrates or quickly dishes to the right man to continue the offensive press. He is an excellent penalty-killer, an aggressive forechecker, and fearless in the dirty areas, whether it be the front or the corners. Currently playing wing, but can play pivot too."
4,2013,Seth Jones,"The son of former Pro basketball player Popeye Jones  found a love for hockey and is the most fluid defenesman prsopect to come along in awhile. Much has been talked about him as a special player who could become a dominant player at the pro level. All the evidence is not in but so far, he keeps growing-on and off the ice. He plays a strong position game and is very calm and deliberate with his actions. He is deceptively quick but as many big men, he looks nonchalant while plying his trade. Uses his size and his balance in the small battles that can go unnoticed. A very good up-ice passer and skates like a smaller man. Excellent hockey IQ and positionally functional strength. His game is continually improving and may be even bigger by the draft. Doesn't go out of his way to dominate attackers physically but there is some nasty there. When that, and his overall game matures, he may be a dominant NHL player."
2,2013,Sasha Alexsander Barkov,"The youngest player (16) to ever score a point in the Finnish SM-liiga league.  His father was a Spartak Russian hockey boy, who married a Finn. A patient player who is strong on the puck, and is confident he can hold on the biscuit while surveying options, and then surprise with excellent passes to the open attacker. Possesses tremendous hands and vision. He is working on his skating and speed, but has excellent balance and ability to handle the puck at his top speed. This is big centre, and in any other draft, there would be little question that he would be a top two selection, because even if he cannot fufill the promise of being a dominant first line centre, he WILL play centre in the NHL a be very good player. He is used on the PP point, and the half wall, and has a lot to do with the success of Artturi Lehkonen, who is getting lots of press as top prospect. In the Finnish pro league, he controls the tempo, and is tremendously strong when in control of the puck, and was the ninth leading scorer as a 17 year old. This man is the real deal, his short area quickness seals the deal that a GM shouldn't pass on him for another forward. He sustained a shoulder injury in the Finnish League for Tappara, and was lost for the rest of this year's playoff, but the injury will not affect is lofty draft status. This is a big two way centre that projects at very least as an NHL second line centre who embraces the role as big minute guy."
